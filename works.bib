However, the buoyancy of diving animals varies as a function of their body condition, and the effects of these changes on swimming costs and foraging behaviour have been poorly examined. A novel animal-borne accelerometer was developed that recorded the number of flipper strokes, which allowed us to monitor the number of strokes per metre swam (hereafter, referred to as strokes-per-metre) by female northern elephant seals over their months-long, oceanic foraging migrations.Asnegatively buoyant seals increased their fat stores and buoyancy, the strokes-per-metre increased slightly in the buoyancy-aided direction (descending), but decreased significantly in the buoyancy-hindered direction (ascending), with associated changes in swim speed and gliding duration. Overall, the round-trip strokes-per-metre decreased and reached a minimum value when seals achieved neutral buoyancy. Consistent with foraging theory, seals stayed longer at foraging depths when their round-trip strokes-per-metre was less. Therefore, neutrally buoyant divers gained an energetic advantage via reduced swimming costs, which resulted in an increase in time spent foraging at depth, suggesting a foraging benefit of being fat.},

  abstract = {Ocean-driven basal melting of Antarctica's floating ice shelves accounts for about half of their mass loss in steady state, where gains in ice-shelf mass are balanced by losses. Ice-shelf thickness changes driven by varying basal melt rates modulate mass loss from the grounded ice sheet and its contribution to sea level, and the changing meltwater fluxes influence climate processes in the Southern Ocean. Existing continent-wide melt-rate datasets have no temporal variability, introducing uncertainties in sea level and climate projections. Here, we combine surface height data from satellite radar altimeters with satellite-derived ice velocities and a new model of firn-layer evolution to generate a high-resolution map of time-averaged (2010--2018) basal melt rates and time series (1994--2018) of meltwater fluxes for most ice shelves. Total basal meltwater flux in 1994 (1,090\,{\textpm}\,150\,Gt\,yr--1) was similar to the steady-state value (1,100\,{\textpm}\,60\,Gt\,yr--1), but increased to 1,570\,{\textpm}\,140\,Gt\,yr--1 in 2009, followed by a decline to 1,160\,{\textpm}\,150\,Gt\,yr--1 in 2018. For the four largest `cold-water' ice shelves, we partition meltwater fluxes into deep and shallow sources to reveal distinct signatures of temporal variability, providing insights into climate forcing of basal melting and the impact of this melting on the Southern Ocean.},

Determining death after the infusion relies on the observation of physical variables. However, it is unknown when cortical electrical activity and brainstem function are lost in a sequence of events before death. Hypothesis/Objectives: To examine changes in the electrical activity of the cerebral cortex and brainstem during an overdose of pentobarbital sodium solution for euthanasia. Our testing hypothesis is that isoelectric pattern of the brain in support of brain death occurs before absence of electrocardiogram (ECG) activity. Animals: Fifteen horses requiring euthanasia. Methods: Prospective observational study. Horses with neurologic, orthopedic, and cardiac illnesses were selected and instrumented for recording of electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER), and ECG. Physical and neurologic (brainstem reflexes) variables were monitored. Results: Loss of cortical electrical activity occurred during or within 52 seconds after the infusion of euthanasia solution. Cessation of brainstem function as evidenced by a lack of brainstem reflexes and disappearance of the BAER happened subsequently. Despite undetectable heart sounds, palpable arterial pulse, and mean arterial pressure, recordable ECG was the last variable to be lost after the infusion (5.5--16 minutes after end of the infusion). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Overdose of pentobarbital sodium solution administered IV is an effective, fast, and humane method of euthanasia. Brain death occurs within 73--261 seconds of the infusion. Although absence of ECG activity takes longer to occur, brain death has already occurred.},

This transition comes with great benefits but also significant challenges that are likely to affect those who carry out the research, usually early career researchers (ECRs). Here, we describe key benefits, including reputational gains, increased chances of publication, and a broader increase in the reliability of research. The increased chances of publication are supported by exploratory analyses indicating null findings are substantially more likely to be published via open registered reports in comparison to more conventional methods. These benefits are balanced by challenges that we have encountered and that involve increased costs in terms of flexibility, time, and issues with the current incentive structure, all of which seem to affect ECRs acutely. Although there are major obstacles to the early adoption of open science, overall open science practices should benefit both the ECR and improve the quality of research. We review 3 benefits and 3 challenges and provide suggestions from the perspective of ECRs for moving towards open science practices, which we believe scientists and institutions at all levels would do well to consider.},

Therefore, we evaluated a supervised machine learning algorithm, Somnivore\textsuperscript{TM}, for automated wake--sleep stage classification. We designed an algorithm that extracts features from various input channels, following a brief session of manual scoring, and provides automated wake-sleep stage classification for each recording. For algorithm validation, polysomnography data was obtained from independent laboratories, and include normal, cognitively-impaired, and alcohol-treated human subjects (total {$<$}italic{$>$}n{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 52), narcoleptic mice and drug-treated rats (total {$<$}italic{$>$}n{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 56), and pigeons ({$<$}italic{$>$}n{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 5). Training and testing sets for validation were previously scored manually by 1--2 trained sleep technologists from each laboratory. {$<$}italic{$>$}F{$<$}/italic{$>$}-measure was used to assess precision and sensitivity for statistical analysis of classifier output and human scorer agreement. The algorithm gave high concordance with manual visual scoring across all human data (wake 0.91 {\textpm} 0.01; N1 0.57 {\textpm} 0.01; N2 0.81 {\textpm} 0.01; N3 0.86 {\textpm} 0.01; REM 0.87 {\textpm} 0.01), which was comparable to manual inter-scorer agreement on all stages. Similarly, high concordance was observed across all rodent (wake 0.95 {\textpm} 0.01; NREM 0.94 {\textpm} 0.01; REM 0.91 {\textpm} 0.01) and pigeon (wake 0.96 {\textpm} 0.006; NREM 0.97 {\textpm} 0.01; REM 0.86 {\textpm} 0.02) data. Effects of classifier learning from single signal inputs, simple stage reclassification, automated removal of transition epochs, and training set size were also examined. In summary, we have developed a polysomnography analysis program for automated sleep-stage classification of data from diverse species.

Deeper coma generally displays a burst-suppression pattern characterized by alternating episodes of isoelectric (flat) EEG and bursting slow waves. The latter are the result of cortical hyperexcitability, as demonstrated by intracellular recordings in anesthetized animals. Further deepening of the coma yields to continuous isoelectric electroencephalogram and eventually results in a newly discovered type of spiky waves that have been termed Nu-complexes. The paper discusses the structures participating in the genesis of burst suppression, the afferent mechanisms, and the reasons for which this activity should or should not be regarded as an epileptic disorder.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "Status Epilepticus".},

  abstract = {In principle, a priori knowledge of organism-scale spectral signatures for key ecological end-members is a basic requirement for identifying coral reef benthic communities using hyperspectral remotely-sensed imagery. Spectral signatures of end-members are now relatively well known for predominant reef taxa (coral, algae) and for the background of the living communities (e.g. sediments). What remains unclear is whether the criteria for spectral discrimination between end-members at the millimeter or centimeter scale remain valid when attempting to process images at several meters resolution. In other words, is it possible to scale-up spectral criteria of identification from species/organisms to communities? We address this issue with in situ and `compact airborne spectrometer imager' (CASI) hyperspectral measurements of the tropical marine flora of 2 South Pacific Ocean coral reefs. Targets were the dominant algal species and communities encountered in the shallow (0 to 3 m) barrier and fringing reefs of Moorea Island and the outer margin of the rim of Rangiroa Atoll (French Polynesia). Stepwise wavelength selection and linear discriminant analysis highlighted the key non-redundant wavelengths necessary to achieve good separation between the predefined ecological groups. Comparison of the wavelengths identified from in situ and airborne measurements allowed definition of a subset of common wavelengths that were robust to changes in spatial scale and still provided excellent discrimination and classification accuracy between the ecological groups. These results suggest that continuous spectral signatures acquired in situ at the centimeter scale can be used to select key discrete wavelengths for remote-sensing observations of communities at the meter scale despite the spatial heterogeneity in benthic cover and the resulting spectral mixing.},

Seven juvenile northern elephant seals were captured at A{\~n}o Nuevo, CA, instrumented and translocated to release sites around Monterey Bay. Heart rate and dive depth were recorded using custom-designed data loggers and analogue tape monitors during the seals' return to A{\~n}o Nuevo. Heart rates during apnoea and eupnoea were recorded from four of the seals after they hauled out on the beach. Diving patterns were very similar to those of naturally migrating juveniles. The heart rate response to apnoea at sea and on land was a prompt bradycardia, but only at sea was there an anticipatory tachycardia before breathing commenced. Heart rate at sea declined by 64 \% from the surface rate of 107{\textpm}3 beats min-1 (mean {\textpm} S.D.), while heart rate on land declined by 31 \% from the eupnoeic rate of 65{\textpm}8 beats min-1. Diving heart rate was inversely related to dive duration in a non-linear fashion best described by a continuous, curvilinear model, while heart rate during apnoea on land was independent of the duration of apnoea. Occasionally, instantaneous heart rate fell as low as 3 beats min-1 during diving. Although bradycardia occurs in response to apnoea both at sea and on land, only at sea is heart rate apparently regulated to minimise eupnoeic time and to ration oxygen stores to ensure adequate supplies for the heart and brain not only as the dive progresses normally but also when a dive is abnormally extended.},

  abstract = {Ocean acidification represents a key threat to coral reefs by reducing the calcification rate of framework builders. In addition, acidification is likely to affect the relationship between corals and their symbiotic dinoflagellates and the productivity of this association. However, little is known about how acidification impacts on the physiology of reef builders and how acidification interacts with warming. Here, we report on an 8-week study that compared bleaching, productivity, and calcification responses of crustose coralline algae (CCA) and branching (Acropora) and massive (Porites) coral species in response to acidification and warming. Using a 30-tank experimental system, we manipulated CO2 levels to simulate doubling and three- to fourfold increases [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projection categories IV and VI] relative to present-day levels under cool and warm scenarios. Results indicated that high CO2 is a bleaching agent for corals and CCA under high irradiance, acting synergistically with warming to lower thermal bleaching thresholds. We propose that CO2 induces bleaching via its impact on photoprotective mechanisms of the photosystems. Overall, acidification impacted more strongly on bleaching and productivity than on calcification. Interestingly, the intermediate, warm CO2 scenario led to a 30\% increase in productivity in Acropora, whereas high CO2 lead to zero productivity in both corals. CCA were most sensitive to acidification, with high CO2 leading to negative productivity and high rates of net dissolution. Our findings suggest that sensitive reef-building species such as CCA may be pushed beyond their thresholds for growth and survival within the next few decades whereas corals will show delayed and mixed responses.},

  abstract = {Foraging behaviour of marine predators inferred from the analysis of horizontal or vertical movements commonly lack quantitative information about foraging success. Several marine mammal species are known to perform dives where they passively drift in the water column, termed ``drift'' dives. The drift rate is determined by the animal's buoyancy, which can be used to make inference regarding body condition. Long term dive records retrieved via satellite uplink are often summarized before transmission. This loss of resolution hampers identification of drift dives. Here, we develop a flexible, hierarchically structured approach to identify drift dives and estimate the drift rate from the summarized time-depth profiles that are increasingly available to the global research community. Based on high-resolution dive data from southern elephant seals, we classify dives as drift/non-drift and apply a summarization algorithm. We then (i) automatically generate dive groups based on inflection point ordering using a `Reverse' Broken-Stick Algorithm, (ii) develop a set of threshold criteria to apply across groups, ensuring non-drift dives are most efficiently rejected, and (iii) finally implement a custom Kalman filter to retain the remaining dives that are within the seals estimated drifting time series. Validation with independent data sets shows our method retains approximately 3\% of all dives, of which 88\% are true drift dives. The drift rate estimates are unbiased, with the upper 95\% quantile of the mean squared error between the daily averaged summarized profiles using our method (SDDR) and the observed daily averaged drift rate (ODDR) being only 0.0015. The trend of the drifting time-series match expectations for capital breeders, showing the lowest body condition commencing foraging trips and a progressive improvement as they remain at sea. Our method offers sufficient resolution to track small changes in body condition at a fine temporal scale. This approach overcomes a long-term challenge for large existing and ongoing data collections, with potential application across other drift diving species. Enabling robust identification of foraging success at sea offers a rare and valuable opportunity for monitoring marine ecosystem productivity in space and time by tracking the success of a top predator.},

  abstract = {Sea lions and fur seals have two broadly divergent foraging patterns. Lactating sea lions generally undertake short trips (1-2 days) foraging mostly on the benthos of continental shelf areas. In contrast, lactating fur seals generally undertake longer trips (4-23 days) foraging mostly on vertically migrating prey in oceanic frontal structures or continental shelf-edges with upwelling regions. Associated with the observed divergent trends of epipelagic and benthic foraging appear to be differences in the population dynamics of sea lions and fur seals. Populations of the various sea lion species have experienced little recovery since the sealing era, whereas fur seals have generally experienced rapid population recovery rates. The divergent patterns of foraging between the two otariid groups were originally thought to be due to the mode of insulation and diving ability. Subsequent studies, however, have shown that some fur seal species regularly forage at pelagic depths deeper and longer than some sea lions. Alternatively, the larger body size of sea lions may make foraging on small pelagic prey energy-inefficient and, hence, may explain why throughout most of their distribution sea lions have adopted the benthic foraging mode. Indeed, exceptions to the general fur seal and sea lion foraging patterns have been documented, which may be related to the productivity of their local marine habitat. California sea lions display epipelagic foraging behavior in the rich California Current, while Australian fur seals have been shown to forage exclusively over the shallow continental shelf of Bass Strait (southeast Australia), a region recognized as being an area of low oceanic productivity. Interestingly, these uncharacteristic foraging modes are associated with population dynamics uncharacteristic for the respective phylogenetic groups: California sea lions have been steadily increasing, while the Australian fur seal has exhibited a very slow recovery in comparison to the conspecific cape fur seal which feeds epipelagically in the rich Benguela current and is now the most numerous otariid.},

Olfactory specialists were shown to arrive at baited underwater video drops earlier, and in greater numbers, than non-olfactory species. This pattern was reversed in non-olfactory species, which were found to dominate underwater census surveys and appear less at baited underwater video drops. The sensory capacity of a species was found to be a larger determinant for fish abundance at baited underwater video drops than was the actual density of that species. The result of this study has ramifications for fish sampling techniques that use chemical stimuli to attract fish species, such as in the deep sea. The baited underwater video technique was highly effective at determining the diel activity of fish species.},

Predictions from these models inform conservation policy, invasive species management and disease-control measures. However, predictions are subject to uncertainty, the degree and source of which is often unrecognized. Here, we review the SDM literature in the context of uncertainty, focusing on three main classes of SDM: niche-based models, demographic models and process-based models. We identify sources of uncertainty for each class and discuss how uncertainty can be minimized or included in the modelling process to give realistic measures of confidence around predictions. Because this has typically not been performed, we conclude that uncertainty in SDMs has often been underestimated and a false precision assigned to predictions of geographical distribution. We identify areas where development of new statistical tools will improve predictions from distribution models, notably the development of hierarchical models that link different types of distribution model and their attendant uncertainties across spatial scales. Finally, we discuss the need to develop more defensible methods for assessing predictive performance, quantifying model goodness-of-fit and for assessing the significance of model covariates.},

Finally, we assess how perceived motivations mediate the relationship between solution position and credibility.

We also found that the influence of solution position on perceived credibility was mediated by several motivation perceptions; most notably through perception that the scientist was motivated to: (a) serve the public and (b) persuade the public.

Sea-level rise will increase flood risk, but substantial impacts could happen from reef loss alone without better near-term management. We provide a global, process-based valuation of an ecosystem service across an entire marine biome at (sub)national levels.

Despite its considerable importance, SDM has received relatively little attention from the computer science community.

These examples, spanning predator-prey interactions, state-dependent risk-taking, resource tracking, and collective movement decisions, show how biologging can resolve long-standing mysteries if research is designed with a solid conceptual foundation. The next phase of biologging science will require scaling studies from individuals to populations and possibly to ecosystems. It will also benefit from building equitable international and interdisciplinary partnerships, bridging the terrestrial-marine divide, and addressing ethical conundrums including animal handling and open science practices. Doing so will help cement biologging as an indispensable tool for producing generalizable knowledge about how organisms and ecosystems function.},

Over the past decades a myriad of efforts have emerged to prevent this erosion. In this work, we reviewed and systematically coded 138 ILK conservation initiatives published in academic papers in order to explore trends in participation, digitalization, timing, location, and approach of the initiatives. We also explored factors influencing initiative inclusiveness. Our findings reveal that ILK holders are generally absent from most phases of the studied initiatives, although IT-based and in situ initiatives (i.e., education and community based conservation) appear as the exceptions. We also found that ex situ initiatives (i.e., research/documentation and policy/legislation efforts) are predominant, despite the challenges they reportedly face. These findings call for re-formulating the ways in which ex situ ILK conservation is done and for supporting in situ and IT based initiatives, as they offer the potential to lead the participatory turn.},

With the explosive growth of large language models (LLMs) and other forms of artificial intelligence (AI), we discuss here the promise and perils associated with their use. We conclude that, when judiciously used, AI has the potential to speed up and hopefully improve the process of evidence synthesis, which can be particularly useful for underfunded applied fields, such as conservation science.},

Wildbook is an autonomous computational system that starts from massive collections of images and, by detecting various species of animals and identifying individuals, combined with sophisticated data management, turns them into high resolution information database, enabling scientific inquiry, conservation, and citizen science. We have built Wildbooks for whales (flukebook.org), sharks (whaleshark.org), two species of zebras (Grevy's and plains), and several others. In January 2016, Wildbook enabled the first ever full species (the endangered Grevy's zebra) census using photographs taken by ordinary citizens in Kenya. The resulting numbers are now the official species census used by IUCN Red List: http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7950/0. In 2016, Wildbook partnered up with WWF to build Wildbook for Sea Turtles, Internet of Turtles (IoT), as well as systems for seals and lynx. Most recently, we have demonstrated that we can now use publicly available social media images to count and track wild animals. In this paper we present and discuss both the impact and challenges that the use of crowdsourced images can have on wildlife conservation.},

Telemetry permitted the study of unrestrained animals in their home cages, during both sleep and wakefulness. These mature chimpanzees slept a mean of 9 h 40 min at night, but they slept hardly at all during the day. The sleep EEG of the animals contained very few sigma rhythms, vertex sharp waves and K complexes as compared with adult human subjects or juvenile chimpanzees. Awakenings were very frequent, amounting to 17\% of the sleep periods, and episodes of each stage were short because of frequent stage shifts. Stage REM occupied only 15{\textasciitilde} of the sleep recorded. Although the findings confirm the general similarity of chimpanzee sleep patterns to those of humans, the records were actually more similar to recordings of lower primates than to those of humans, it is hard to explain these findings phylogenetically, and they may reflect the effects of captivity on laboratory animals.},

  abstract = {Our ability to inform conservation and management of species is fundamentally limited by the availability of relevant biogeographic data, use of statistically robust predictive models, and presentation of results to decision makers. Despite the ubiquity of presence-only models, where available, survey effort should be included in the modeling process to limit spatial bias. The biogeographic archive therefore should be able to store and serve related spatial information such as lines of survey effort or polygons of the study area, best accomplished through geospatial web services such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Feature Service (WFS). Ideally data could then be easily fetched by modelers into a scientific workflow, providing a visually intuitive, modular, reusable canvas for linking analytical processes without the need to code. Species distribution model results should be easily accessible to decision makers, such as through a web-based spatial decision support system (SDSS). With these principles in mind, we describe our progress to date serving marine animal biogeographic data from OBIS-SEAMAP (http://seamap.env.duke.edu), and consuming the data for predictive environmental modeling of cetaceans. Using geospatial web services to automate the scientific workflow process, marine mammal observations from OBIS-SEAMAP are used to sample through date-synchronous remotely sensed satellite data for building multivariate habitat models using a variety of statistical techniques (GLM, GAM, and CART). We developed custom scientific workflows using ESRI Model Builder, ArcGIS geoprocessor, R statistical package, Python scripting language, PostGIS geodatabase, and UMN MapServer. These model outputs are then passed to an SDSS with spatial summary capability. Custom products will be open-source and freely available. In the future, we hope to integrate technologies such as OGC WCS, OPeNDAP, and Kepler. The principles and lessons described here can be broadly applied to serving biogeographic data, species distribution modeling, and decision support within the ecological informatics community.},

To tackle a new application, a researcher typically tries to map their problem onto one of these existing methods, often influenced by their familiarity with specific algorithms and by the availability of corresponding software implementations. In this study, we describe an alternative methodology for applying machine learning, in which a bespoke solution is formulated for each new application. The solution is expressed through a compact modelling language, and the corresponding custom machine learning code is then generated automatically. This model-based approach offers several major advantages, including the opportunity to create highly tailored models for specific scenarios, as well as rapid prototyping and comparison of a range of alternative models. Furthermore, newcomers to the field of machine learning do not have to learn about the huge range of traditional methods, but instead can focus their attention on understanding a single modelling environment. In this study, we show how probabilistic graphical models, coupled with efficient inference algorithms, provide a very flexible foundation for model-based machine learning, and we outline a large-scale commercial application of this framework involving tens of millions of users. We also describe the concept of probabilistic programming as a powerful software environment for model-based machine learning, and we discuss a specific probabilistic programming language called Infer.NET, which has been widely used in practical applications.},

However, observations are temporally and spatially sparse. Here we report the first hourly-resolved optically quantified POC and PIC sedimentation rate time series from an autonomous Lagrangian Carbon Flux Explorer (CFE), which monitored particle flux using an imaging optical sedimentation recorder (OSR) at depths below 140 m in the Santa Cruz Basin, CA, in May 2012, and in January and March 2013. Highest POC vertical flux ( {$\sim$} 100--240 mmol C m-2 d-1) occurred in January, when most settling material was millimeter- to centimeter-sized aggregates but when surface biomass was low; fluxes were {$\sim$} 18 and {$\sim$} 6 mmol C m-2 d-1, respectively, in March and May, under high surface biomass conditions. An unexpected discovery was that January 2013 fluxes measured by CFE were 20 times higher than that measured by simultaneously deployed surface-tethered OSR; multiple lines of evidence indicate strong undersampling of aggregates larger than 1 mm in the latter case. Furthermore, the January 2013 CFE fluxes were about 10 times higher than observed during multiyear sediment trap observations in the nearby Santa Barbara and San Pedro basins. The strength of carbon export in biologically dynamic California coastal waters is likely underestimated by at least a factor of 3 and at times by a factor of 20.},

  abstract = {Habitat associations are an integral part of coral reef community structure. Commonly, one organism lives in such close association within or near another that a spatial refuge occurs, whereby one of the organisms provides protection to the other. This is often the result of defenses of the host deterring an associate organism's consumers. In Moorea, French Polynesia, the range and abundance of the brown macroalga, Turbinaria ornata, have increased drastically since 1980 such that dense aggregations of this macroalga are a dominant component of the backreef habitat. Turbinaria ornata is both mechanically and chemically defended from herbivores. Other species of macroalgae grow within aggregations of Turbinaria and may benefit from these defenses. This study investigates whether aggregations of Turbinaria create a refuge from herbivory for associate macroalgae. When Turbinaria aggregations were removed experimentally, there was a significant increase in the number of associate algal species. Moreover, an herbivory assay using the palatable local alga Acanthophora spicifera identified herbivory as the mechanism for lower diversity on bommies lacking Turbinaria aggregations. The local increase in algal richness due to the refuge from herbivory afforded by Turbinaria may be an important contribution to macroalgal and community dynamics on reefs in Moorea, French Polynesia.},

  abstract = {Regional blood flow and cardiac output were determined by distribution of radioactive microspheres injected via catheter into the left ventricle during experimental diving and recovery in juvenile spotted seals (Phoca vitulina largha) and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus). Cardiac output was 9.7 L/min before diving, declined 90\% during submersion and increased to 12.1 L/min after 40 s of recovery. Left ventricular myocardial perfusion declined from 179 +/- 24 (21) to 25 +/- 2 (6) ml/min . 100 g at 2 min submersion, and measured 23 +/- 3 (8) after 10 min of submersion. Cerebral cortical flow was reduced from a pre-dive value of 115 +/- 3 (15) to 40 +/- 5 (3) and 49 +/- 6 (3) at 2 and 5 min of diving, respectively, but increased to 253 +/- 14 (4) ml/min . 100 g at 10 min along with elevated PCO2 (84 torr) and lowered pH (7.10) in arterial blood. It remained at that level in recovery. Brain stem perfusion after 10 min submersion was still identical with control, but increased to 275\% of control in recovery. Adrenal flow decreased to 34 and 27\% of control at 2 and 5 min of diving, respectively. Recovery flow after 10 min of diving was 200\% of control. Liver, kidney, fat, skin, and stomach were ischemic throughout the dive. Recovery flow increased slowly in these tissues. Skeletal muscle (M. psoas) was perfused at a low rate. (3 ml/min . 100 g) pre-dive and was ischemic during diving. Recovery muscle perfusion was variable at different sites (from 5 to 105 ml/min . 100 g). Pre-dive pulmonary capillary perfusion was 58 +/- 8 (9) ml/min . 100 g, decreased to 7 +/- 0 (3) ml/min . 100 g min of submersion, and had increased to 50\% of pre-dive value after 40 s of recovery from a 10 min dive. Conclusions are: (1) previous information from implanted flow transducers was confirmed, (2) detailed data for discrete tissues elaborate the concept of selective redistribution of cardiac output in diving seals, (3) non-uniform reperfusion contributes to the maintenance of arterial pressure during recovery, and (4) substantial A-V shunting of cardiac output took place in the first 2-5 min of the dive, when total capillary/nutritive flow was low. Late in the dive, however, CO was routed through systemic capillaries mainly in the cerebral circulation and less than 15\% through A-V shunts.},

Eleven-day-old chicks were divided into three groups: two non-deprived (N-DEP1 and N-DEP2) and one deprived for 8 h (DEP-8H). Deprivation was performed by placing chicks on a treadmill on which they were forced to walk continuously. Sleep behaviour was recorded for 6 h consecutively immediately after the end of sleep deprivation. During the recovery period, sleep-deprived chicks slept for a longer duration, spent significantly more time in binocular sleep and slept for significantly longer episodes that did control chicks. Regarding Mo-Un sleep, sleep deprivation seems to affect the right hemisphere by reducing the number of episodes and the time spent sleeping with the left eye closed. These results suggest that sleep-deprivation significantly influences the pattern of sleep in domestic chicks allowing for a better recovery. {\copyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

We show that dogs do not only fulfil all behavioral and polygraphic criteria of sleep, but are characterized by sleep homeostasis, diurnal pattern of activity, circadian rhythms, ultradian sleep cycles, socio-ecologically and environmentally shaped wake-sleep structure, sleep-related memory improvement, as well as specific sleep disorders. Developmental patterns of sleep-related physiological indices, as well as parallel trends in age-dependent changes in cognition and sleep were evidenced in dogs.},

  abstract = {The magnitude and controls of particulate carbon exported from surface waters and its remineralization at depth are poorly constrained. The Carbon Flux Explorer (CFE), a Lagrangian float-deployed imaging sediment trap, has been designed to optically measure the hourly variations of particle flux to kilometer depths for months to seasons while relaying data in near-real time to shore via satellite without attending ships. The main optical proxy for particle load recorded by the CFE, volume attenuance (VA; units of mATN\&thinsp;cm2), while rigorously defined and highly precise, has not been robustly calibrated in terms of particulate organic carbon (POC), nitrogen (PN) and phosphorus (PP). In this study, a novel 3-D-printed particle sampler using cutting edge additive manufacturing was developed and integrated with the CFE. Two such modified floats (CFE-Cals) were deployed a total of 15 times for 18--24\&thinsp;h periods to gain calibration imagery and samples at depths near 150\&thinsp;m in four contrasting productivity environments during the June 2017 California Current Ecosystem Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) process study. Regression slopes for VA\&thinsp;:\&thinsp;POC and VA\&thinsp;:\&thinsp;PN (units mATN\&thinsp;cm2:\&thinsp;mmol; R2, n, p value in parentheses) were 1.01{\texttimes}104 (0.86, 12, \&lt;\&thinsp;0.001) and 1.01{\texttimes}105 (0.86, 15, \&lt;\&thinsp;0.001), respectively, and were not sensitive to particle size classes or the contrasting environments encountered. PP was not well correlated with VA, reflecting the high lability of P relative to C and N. The volume attenuance flux (VAF) to POC flux calibration is compared to previous estimates.},

  abstract = {To deliver infrastructure that sustain our communities, economy, and environment, we must innovate, modernize, and even revolutionize our approach to infrastructure development. Change takes courage, but as one starts down the path of innovation, what was once novel becomes more familiar, more established. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is walking this path with our partners through the Engineering With Nature (EWN) Initiative, integrating human engineering with natural systems. The International Guidelines on Natural and Nature-Based Features for Flood Risk Management are the next step toward revolutionary infrastructure development---a set of real-world guidelines to help familiarize us with what was once novel. USACE and collaborators around the world have been building, learning, and documenting the best practices for constructing Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBF) for decades. The consolidation of these lessons into a single guidance document gives decision-makers and practitioners a much-needed resource to pursue, consider, and apply NNBF for flood risk management while expanding value through infrastructure. Relationships and partnerships are vital ingredients for innovation and progress. The NNBF Guidelines was achieved because of the strong relationships in the nature-based engineering community. The magnitude and diversity of contributors to the NNBF Guidelines have resulted in a robust resource that provides value beyond a single agency, sector, or nation. Similarly, the work of incorporating NNBF into projects will require us to strengthen our relationships across organizations, mandates, and missions to achieve resilient communities. I hope you are inspired by the collaborative achievement of the NNBF Guidelines and will draw from this resource to develop innovative solutions to current and future flood risk management challenges. There is a lot we can achieve together along the path of revolutionary infrastructure development.},

  abstract = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the ecology of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including devel- opment rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Even- tually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

  abstract = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the ecology of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics.},

  abstract = {This paper reflects on a number of trends towards a more open and reproducible approach to geographic and spatial data science over recent years. In particular, it considers trends towards Big Data, and the impacts this is having on spatial data analysis and modelling. It identifies a turn in academia towards coding as a core analytic tool, and away from proprietary software tools offering `black boxes' where the internal workings of the analysis are not revealed. It is argued that this closed form software is problematic and considers a number of ways in which issues identified in spatial data analysis (such as the MAUP) could be overlooked when working with closed tools, leading to problems of interpretation and possibly inappropriate actions and policies based on these. In addition, this paper considers the role that reproducible and open spatial science may play in such an approach, taking into account the issues raised. It highlights the dangers of failing to account for the geographical properties of data, now that all data are spatial (they are collected somewhere), the problems of a desire for \$\$n\$\$\,=\,all observations in data science and it identifies the need for a critical approach. This is one in which openness, transparency, sharing and reproducibility provide a mantra for defensible and robust spatial data science.},

  abstract = {Intraspecific group hunting has received considerable attention because of the close links between cooperative behaviour and its cognitive demands. Accordingly, comparisons between species have focused on behaviours that can potentially distinguish between the different levels of cognitive complexity involved, such as "intentional" communication between partners in order to initiate a joint hunt, the adoption of different roles during a joint hunt (whether consistently or alternately), and the level of food sharing following a successful hunt. Here we report field observations from the Red Sea on the highly coordinated and communicative interspecific hunting between the grouper, Plectropomus pessuliferus, and the giant moray eel, Gymnothorax javanicus. We provide evidence of the following: (1) associations are nonrandom, (2) groupers signal to moray eels in order to initiate joint searching and recruit moray eels to prey hiding places, (3) signalling is dependent on grouper hunger level, and (4) both partners benefit from the association. The benefits of joint hunting appear to be due to complementary hunting skills, reflecting the evolved strategies of each species, rather than individual role specialisation during joint hunts. In addition, the partner species that catches a prey item swallows it whole immediately, making aggressive monopolisation of a carcass impossible. We propose that the potential for monopolisation of carcasses by one partner species represents the main constraint on the evolution of interspecific cooperative hunting for most potentially suitable predator combinations.},

However, the identification and interpretation of independent components is time-consuming and involves subjective decision making. We developed and evaluated a semi-automatic tool designed for clustering independent components from different subjects and/or EEG recordings. Methods CORRMAP is an open-source EEGLAB plug-in, based on the correlation of ICA inverse weights, and finds independent components that are similar to a user-defined template. Component similarity is measured using a correlation procedure that selects components that pass a threshold. The threshold can be either user-defined or determined automatically. CORRMAP clustering performance was evaluated by comparing it with the performance of 11 users from different laboratories familiar with ICA. Results For eye-related artifacts, a very high degree of overlap between users (phi{$>$}0.80), and between users and CORRMAP (phi{$>$}0.80) was observed. Lower degrees of association were found for heartbeat artifact components, between users (phi{$<$}0.70), and between users and CORRMAP (phi{$<$}0.65). Conclusions These results demonstrate that CORRMAP provides an efficient, convenient and objective way of clustering independent components. Significance CORRMAP helps to efficiently use ICA for the removal EEG artifacts.},

  abstract = {Birds and mammals share specialized forms of sleep including slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM), raising the question of why and how specialized sleep evolved. Extensive prior studies concluded that avian sleep lacked many features characteristic of mammalian sleep, and therefore that specialized sleep must have evolved independently in birds and mammals. This has been challenged by evidence of more complex sleep in multiple songbird species. To extend this analysis beyond songbirds, we examined a species of parrot, the sister taxon to songbirds. We implanted adult budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) with electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) electrodes to evaluate sleep architecture, and video monitored birds during sleep. Sleep was scored with manual and automated techniques, including automated detection of slow waves and eye movements. This can help define a new standard for how to score sleep in birds. Budgerigars exhibited consolidated sleep, a pattern also observed in songbirds, and many mammalian species, including humans. We found that REM constituted 26.5\% of total sleep, comparable to humans and an order of magnitude greater than previously reported. Although we observed no spindles, we found a clear state of intermediate sleep (IS) similar to non-REM (NREM) stage 2. Across the night, SWS decreased and REM increased, as observed in mammals and songbirds. Slow wave activity (SWA) fluctuated with a 29-min ultradian rhythm, indicating a tendency to move systematically through sleep states as observed in other species with consolidated sleep. These results are at variance with numerous older sleep studies, including for budgerigars. Here, we demonstrated that lighting conditions used in the prior budgerigar study---and commonly used in older bird studies ---dramatically disrupted budgerigar sleep structure, explaining the prior results. Thus, it is likely that more complex sleep has been overlooked in a broad range of bird species. The similarities in sleep architecture observed in mammals, songbirds, and now budgerigars, alongside recent work in reptiles and basal birds, provide support for the hypothesis that a common amniote ancestor possessed the precursors that gave rise to REM and SWS at one or more loci in the parallel evolution of sleep in higher vertebrates. We discuss this hypothesis in terms of the common plan of forebrain organization shared by reptiles, birds, and mammals.},

Using adaptive structuration theory as a lens to analyze data from a multisite case study, we examine how the structure of agile methods, projects, and organizations affect the adaptation of agile methodologies. We describe the various sources of structure that affect appropriation of agile practices, the set of appropriated practices and their characteristics, and their link to process outcomes. Based on our findings, we provide prescriptions for adapting agile development methodologies. We also discuss how adapted agile practices can address several challenges faced by agile development teams.},

  abstract = {The amount of time asleep varies greatly in mammals, from 3 h in the donkey to 20 h in the armadillo. Previous comparative studies have suggested several functional explanations for interspecific variation in both the total time spent asleep and in rapid-eye movement (REM) or ``quiet'' (non-REM) sleep. In support of specific functional benefits of sleep, these studies reported correlations between time in specific sleep states (NREM or REM) and brain size, metabolic rate, and developmental variables. Here we show that estimates of sleep duration are significantly influenced by the laboratory conditions under which data are collected and that, when analyses are limited to data collected under more standardized procedures, traditional functional explanations for interspecific variation in sleep durations are no longer supported. Specifically, we find that basal metabolic rate correlates negatively rather than positively with sleep quotas, and that neither adult nor neonatal brain mass correlates positively with REM or NREM sleep times. These results contradict hypotheses that invoke energy conservation, cognition, and development as drivers of sleep variation. Instead, the negative correlations of both sleep states with basal metabolic rate and diet are consistent with trade-offs between sleep and foraging time. In terms of predation risk, both REM and NREM sleep quotas are reduced when animals sleep in more exposed sites, whereas species that sleep socially sleep less. Together with the fact that REM and NREM sleep quotas correlate strongly with each other, these results suggest that variation in sleep primarily reflects ecological constraints acting on total sleep time, rather than the independent responses of each sleep state to specific selection pressures. We propose that, within this ecological framework, interspecific variation in sleep duration might be compensated by variation in the physiological intensity of sleep.},

This project examined sleep apnea in northern elephant seal pups (Mirounga angustirostris). The animals exhibited a sequential sleep pattern of wakefulness-slow-wave sleep (SWS)-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep that resembled the normal pattern of mammalian sleep. The typical respiratory pattern during sleep in 4-mo-old pups consisted of short periods of continuous breathing separated by periods of apnea of up to 12 min. Several cycles of apnea and eupnea could occur during a single sleep episode. Breathing during a sleep cycle occurred only in SWS, never during REM sleep. The eupneic heart rate was characterized by significant sinus arrhythmia, and the apneic heart rate was similar to the minimum value during normal sinus arrhythmia. Patterns of change in breathing and heart rate associated with wakefulness and sleep were similar in seals sleeping underwater and on land. When sleeping underwater, the seals raised their heads to the surface to breathe without awakening. The changes in heart rate associated with normal sinus arrhythmia, sleep apnea, and diving apnea appear to be similar, suggesting regulation by a common homeostatic control mechanism.},

  abstract = {Free-ranging animals often cope with fluctuating environmental conditions such as weather, food availability, predation risk, the requirements of breeding, and the influence of anthropogenic factors. Consequently, researchers are increasingly measuring stress markers, especially glucocorticoids, to understand stress, disturbance, and population health. Studying free-ranging animals, however, comes with numerous difficulties posed by environmental conditions and the particular characteristics of study species. Performing measurements under either physical restraint or chemical sedation may affect the physiological variable under investigation and lead to values that may not reflect the standard functional state of the animal. This study measured the stress response resulting from different handling conditions in northern elephant seals and any ensuing influences on carbohydrate metabolism. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) was measured using [6-(3)H]glucose and plasma cortisol concentration was measured from blood samples drawn during three-hour measurement intervals. These measurements were conducted in weanlings and yearlings with and without the use of chemical sedatives--under chemical sedation, physical restraint, or unrestrained. We compared these findings with measurements in adult seals sedated in the field. The method of handling had a significant influence on the stress response and carbohydrate metabolism. Physically restrained weanlings and yearlings transported to the lab had increased concentrations of circulating cortisol (F(11, 46){$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}25.2, p{$<$}0.01) and epinephrine (F(3, 12){$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}5.8, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.01). Physical restraint led to increased EGP (t{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}3.1, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.04) and elevated plasma glucose levels (t{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}8.2, p{$<$}0.01). Animals chemically sedated in the field typically did not exhibit a cortisol stress response. The combination of anesthetic agents (Telazol, ketamine, and diazepam) used in this study appeared to alleviate a cortisol stress response due to handling in the field without altering carbohydrate metabolism. Measures of hormone concentrations and metabolism made under these conditions are more likely to reflect basal values.},

The dataset was built through a broad collaboration combining 39 separate curated photo-ID catalogs, supplemented with community science data. Data from throughout the North Pacific were aggregated into 13 regions, including six breeding regions, six feeding regions, and one migratory corridor. All images were compared with minimal pre-processing using a recently developed image recognition algorithm based on machine learning through artificial intelligence; this system is capable of rapidly detecting matches between individuals with an estimated 97--99\% accuracy. For the 2001--2021 study period, a total of 27,956 unique individuals were documented in 157,350 encounters. Each individual was encountered, on average, in 5.6 sampling periods (i.e., breeding and feeding seasons), with an annual average of 87\% of whales encountered in more than one season. The combined dataset and image recognition tool represents a living and accessible resource for collaborative, basin-wide studies of a keystone marine mammal in a time of rapid ecological change.},

Similar investigation of fundamental auditory processes with fNIRS, however, remains only partially complete. Here we employed a systematic three-level validation approach to investigate whether fNIRS could capture fundamental aspects of bottom-up acoustic processing. We performed a simultaneous fNIRS-EEG experiment with visual and auditory stimulation in 24 participants, which allowed the relationship between changes in neural activity and hemoglobin concentrations to be studied. In the first level, the fNIRS results showed a clear distinction between visual and auditory sensory modalities. Specifically, the results demonstrated area specificity, that is, maximal fNIRS responses in visual and auditory areas for the visual and auditory stimuli respectively, and stimulus selectivity, whereby the visual and auditory areas responded mainly toward their respective stimuli. In the second level, a stimulus-dependent modulation of the fNIRS signal was observed in the visual area, as well as a loudness modulation in the auditory area. Finally in the last level, we observed significant correlations between simultaneously-recorded visual evoked potentials and deoxygenated hemoglobin (DeoxyHb) concentration, and between late auditory evoked potentials and oxygenated hemoglobin (OxyHb) concentration. In sum, these results suggest good sensitivity of fNIRS to low-level sensory processing in both the visual and the auditory domain, and provide further evidence of the neurovascular coupling between hemoglobin concentration changes and non-invasive brain electrical activity.},

  abstract = {The development and application of fish bioenergetics models have flourished in recent years, due in part to the complexity of the issues being faced by fisheries biologists. As with any model, the accuracy of bioenergetics models can be hampered by uncertainty in model parameters. A review of the literature showed that field and laboratory tests of bioenergetics models often result in poor agreement between model predictions and independent data. Nonetheless, bioenergetics modeling continues to be used to make important management decisions. Recent tests of model predictions have shown that parameter uncertainty is influenced by factors such as feeding rate, physiological adaptations, and prey composition and abundance. In an attempt to reduce the uncertainty in modeling applications, we propose a framework that highlights the importance of (1) model evaluation, (2) hypothesis-based parameter testing, and (3) improved communication between model developers and model users. Adherence to this framework will help reduce uncertainty in modeling applications and simultaneously contribute to a broader knowledge of fish physiology and feeding ecology.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models are commonly applied to predict species responses to environmental conditions. A wide variety of models with different properties exist that vary in complexity, which affects their predictive performance and interpretability. Machine learning algorithms are increasingly used because they are capable to capture complex relationships and are often better in prediction. However, to inform environmental management, it is important that a model predicts well for the right reasons. It remains a challenge to select a model with a reasonable level of complexity that captures the true relationship between the response and explanatory variables as good as possible rather than fitting to the noise in the data. In this study we ask: 1) how much predictive performance can we gain by using increasingly complex models, 2) how does model complexity affect the degree of overfitting, and 3) do the inferred responses differ among models and what can we learn from them? To address these questions, we applied eight models with different complexity to predict the probability of occurrence of freshwater macroinvertebrate taxa based on 2729 Swiss monitoring samples. We compared the models in terms of predictive performance during cross-validation and for generalization out of the calibration domain ("extrapolation" or transferability). We applied model agnostic tools to shed light on model interpretability. Contrary to our expectation, all models predicted similarly well during cross-validation, while no model predicted better than the null model during out-of-domain generalization on average over all taxa. Performance was best for taxa with intermediate prevalence. More complex models predicted slightly better than standard statistical models but were prone to overfitting. Overfitting indicates that a model describes not only the signal in the data but also part of the noise. This impedes the interpretation of response shapes learned by the model, because one cannot distinguish the signal from the noise. Furthermore, the strongly overfitting models learned irregular relationships and strong interactions that are ecologically not plausible. Thus, in this study, the minor gain in predictive performance from more complex models was outweighed by the overfitting. Ecological field data that is used as model input or for calibration is typically prone to different sources of variability, from sampling, the measurement process and stochasticity. We therefore call for caution when using complex data-driven models to learn about species responses or to inform environmental management. In such cases, we recommend to compare a range of models regarding their predictive performance, overfitting and response shapes to better understand the robustness of inferred responses.},

Over the course of just a few years, deep learning has revolutionized several research fields such as bioinformatics and medicine with its flexibility and ability to process large and complex datasets. As ecological datasets are becoming larger and more complex, we believe these methods can be useful to ecologists as well. In this paper, we review existing implementations and show that deep learning has been used successfully to identify species, classify animal behaviour and estimate biodiversity in large datasets like camera-trap images, audio recordings and videos. We demonstrate that deep learning can be beneficial to most ecological disciplines, including applied contexts, such as management and conservation. We also identify common questions about how and when to use deep learning, such as what are the steps required to create a deep learning network, which tools are available to help, and what are the requirements in terms of data and computer power. We provide guidelines, recommendations and useful resources, including a reference flowchart to help ecologists get started with deep learning. We argue that at a time when automatic monitoring of populations and ecosystems generates a vast amount of data that cannot be effectively processed by humans anymore, deep learning could become a powerful reference tool for ecologists.},

But it remains difficult to assess the likelihood of future changes in the thermohaline circulation, mainly owing to poorly constrained model parameterizations and uncertainties in the response of the climate system to greenhouse warming. Analyses of past abrupt climate changes help to solve these problems. Data and models both suggest that abrupt climate change during the last glaciation originated through changes in the Atlantic thermohaline circulation in response to small changes in the hydrological cycle. Atmospheric and oceanic responses to these changes were then transmitted globally through a number of feedbacks. The palaeoclimate data and the model results also indicate that the stability of the thermohaline circulation depends on the mean climate state.},

In their natural environment, morays are of course predators, and spend much of their time hidden within caves or burrows, often with just their heads protruding. Some species ambush prey from this position but many venture across the reef, often after darkness, to actively hunt for food. In captivity, morays have a number of requirements that should be taken into account when designing a display system. Firstly, the right-size aquarium should be selected and this usually means a tank of at least 30 UK gallons, even for the smaller species. On the subject of aquascaping, be sure to incorporate large caves into the rock structure.},

  abstract = {The energy and material transferred from Northern elephant seal mothers to their pups during the 26.5-day lactation interval was measured using mass change and water influx data. The dilution of tritium- and deuterium-labelled water was monitored in six female elephant seals and their pups. During the nursing period, pup mass increased by 10.4\% of the initial body mass per day while females lost 4.19\% of their initial body mass per day. Over the entire nursing period, females lost 42.2{\textpm}4.9\% of their initial body mass. Maternal mass transfer to the pup was efficient; pups gained 54.9\% of the mass lost by their mothers. Females lost only 14.9\% of their lean mass compared to 57.9\% of their adipose mass. The fasting metabolic rate of females was 66.2{\textpm}7.5 MJ/day, 2.41 times the predicted standard metabolic rate (SMR) of a terrestrial mammal of equal size; the total energy output was 163{\textpm}11 MJ/day, 5.98 times the predicted SMR. Energy consumption for the entire lactation interval was 4330{\textpm}460 MJ. Milk production accounted for 60\% of this energetic expenditure. This efficient milk production was made possible by temporal separation of lactation and feeding. Separation of feeding from lactation confers several energetic and ecological advantages: reduction in the metabolic overhead used for maintenance metabolism onshore, reduction of foraging effort required to meet the demands of lactation, since feeding can be spread out over a significantly longer interval, and a greater flexibility while foraging at sea due to the absence of the pup. 1986 The Zoological Society of London},

This review focuses on a few areas of field physiology that exemplify how the underlying physiology could not have been understood without appropriate field measurements. The examples we have chosen highlight the methods and inference afforded by an application of this physiological analysis to organismal function in nature, often in extreme environments. The specific areas examined are diving physiology, the thermal physiology of large endothermic fishes, reproductive physiology of air breathing vertebrates, and endocrine physiology of reproductive homeostasis. These areas form a bridge from physiological ecology to evolutionary ecology. All our examples revolve around the central issue of physiological limits as they apply to organismal homeostasis. We view this theme as the cornerstone of physiological analysis and supply a number of paradigms on homeostasis that have been tested in the context of field physiology.},

The process by which they regulate the concentration of their internal water and solute con- centrations is called osmoregulation. Osmoregulation is accomplished by physiological, anatomical and beha- vioural adaptations. These include adaptations that modify the permeability of external surfaces and the development of specialised structures that actively transport solutes and metabolites. Animals face the greatest osmoregulatory challenge in terrestrial envir- onments because concentration gradients there are the greatest. As evaporative cooling is used for thermo- regulation in terrestrial environments, animals are often faced with the dilemma of maintaining either water or thermal balance, but not both.},

Our understanding of these movements has been enhanced by new technologies that now allow us to follow their movements over great distances and long time periods in great detail. This technology provides not only detailed information on the movements of a wide variety of marine species, but also detailed characteristics of the habitats they use and clues to their navigation abilities. Advances in electronic tracking technologies have been coupled with rapid development of statistical and analytical techniques. With these developments, conservation of highly migratory species has been aided by providing new information on where uncommon or endangered species go, what behaviors they perform and why, which habitats are critical, and where they range, as well as, in many cases, better estimates of their population size and the interconnectedness of subpopulations. Together these tools are providing critical insights into the ecology of highly pelagic marine vertebrates that are key for their conservation and management.},

  abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) that has been extensively studied in humans presents also a large interest for studies on animal brain processes. However, since the quality of the recordings is altered by muscular activity, most EEG recordings on animals are obtained using invasive methods with deeply implanted electrodes. This requires anesthesia and can thus only be used in laboratory or clinical settings. As EEG is a very useful tool both for detecting brain alterations due to diseases or accidents and to evaluate the arousal and attentional state of the animal, it seemed crucial to develop a tool that would make such recordings possible in the horse's home environment, with a freely moving horse. Such a tool should neither be invasive nor cause discomforts to the horse as the usual other practice which consists, after shaving the zone, in gluing the electrodes to the skin. To fulfill these requirements, we developed a novel EEG headset adapted to the horse's head that allows an easy and fast positioning of the electrodes and that can be used in the home environment on a freely moving horse. In this study, we show that this EEG headset allows to obtain reliable recordings, and we propose an original evaluation of an animal's ``EEG profile'' that allows comparisons between individuals and situations. This EEG headset opens new possibilities of investigation on horse cognition, and it can also become a useful tool for veterinarians to evaluate cerebral disorders or check the anesthesia level during a surgery.},

  abstract = {Wildfires are destructive fires over the wildland that can wipe out large areas of vegetation and infrastructure. Such fires are hard to control and manage as they can change directions almost instantly, driven by changing environmental conditions. Effective response to such events requires the ability to monitor and predict the behavior of the fire as fast as they change. The WIFIRE project builds an end-to-end cyberinfrastructure for real-time and data-driven simulation, prediction, and visualization of wildfire behavior. One goal of WIFIRE is to provide the tools to predict a more accurate rate of a spreading wildfire. To this end, WIFIRE has developed interfaces for ingesting and visualizing high-density sensor networks to improve fire and weather predictions, and has created a data model for wildfire resources including sensed and archived data, sensors, satellites, cameras, modeling tools, workflows, and social information including Twitter feeds for wildfire research and response. This paper presents WIFIRE's Firemap web platform to make these geospatial data and products accessible. Through a web browser, Firemap enables geospatial information visualization and a unified access to geospatial workflows using Kepler. Using GIS capabilities combined with scalable big data integration and processing, Firemap enables simple execution of the model with options for running ensembles by taking the information uncertainty into account. The results are easily viewable, sharable, repeatable, and can be animated as a time series.},

Sixteen free-ranging dive records were obtained with microcomputer dive recorders attached to 13 adult females from Aiio Nuevo, California, during biannual foraging trips when they were in early or late stages of gestation; swim speed was recorded throughout one dive record. Body composition was measured before and after trips to sea. C dives with a bout length of 2- 10 dives and a mean duration similar to those of other dive types made up 6.3 f 1.9\% of the dives recorded. Swim speed was near or below the recorder stall speed (0.22 m/s) during the second, drift segment of these dives. The rate of vertical depth change while drifting varied little within bouts, was initially significantly correlated with the ratio of fat to lean body mass at departure, and changed systematically as the seals fed while at sea. Females in early gestation, with initial mean body fat of 24\%, drifted down at a mean rate of 0.31 f 0.04 m/s; females in late gestation, with mean body fat approaching 36\%, drifted up at an average rate of 0.17 f 0.05 m/s. The frequency, duration, and temporal pattern of drift dives were correlated with foraging behavior, supporting the hypothesis that drifting while diving is associated with the metabolic cost of processing food. This study provides indirect support for the hypothesis that elephant seals suspend active swimming on certain dives, during which a greater proportion of oxygen stores is allocated to the processing of food, without interrupting the seals' normal pattern of continuous diving and allowing them to remain within their aerobic dive limit},

  abstract = {In capital breeders, individual differences in body size and condition can impact mating effort and success. In addition to the collateral advantages of large body size in competition, large nutrient reserves may offer advantages in endurance rivalry and enable the high rates of energy expenditure associated with mating success. We examined the impacts of body reserves and dominance rank on energy expenditure, water flux, mating success, and breeding tenure in the adult male northern elephant seal, a polygynous, capital breeder. Adult males expended energy at a rate of  MJ d-1, which is equivalent to 3.1 times the standard metabolic rate predicted by Kleiber's equation. Despite high rates of energy expenditure and a long fasting duration, males spared lean tissue effectively, deriving a mean of 7\% of their metabolism from protein catabolism. Body composition had a strong impact on the ability to spare lean tissue during breeding. When controlling for body size, energy expenditure, depletion of blubber reserves, and water efflux were significantly greater in alpha males than in subordinate males. Large body size was associated with increased reproductive effort, tenure on shore, dominance rank, and reproductive success. Terrestrial locomotion and topography appeared to strongly influence energy expenditure. Comparisons with conspecific females suggest greater total seasonal reproductive effort in male northern elephant seals when controlling for the effects of body mass. In polygynous capital breeding systems, male effort may be strongly influenced by physiological state and exceed that of females.},

Given their deep diving and spatial distribution, their immediate response to a severe El Nino was expected to give insight into the timing, scale and magnitude of El Nino Southern Oscillation impacts on a large marine predator. Time-depth records and Argos-linked satellite tracks were obtained from adult females departing on post-breeding foraging migrations from 1990 to 1999, including females foraging during the 1998 El Nino. Rates of mass gain and trip duration were recorded for females from 1983 to 1999. Movement tracks of females in 1998 were similar to those observed in non-El Nino years. Rate of mass gain at sea was 0.29 +/- 0.36 kg d(-1) in 1998, the lowest measured since 1983. Marked declines in the mass gain rate of females were noted in severe El Nino years, but not in moderate El Nino years. Females increase spring foraging trip duration to compensate for decreases in foraging success. In 1998, the frequency distribution and temporal pattern of dive shapes suggested reduced residence time in prey patches and increased travel time between patches and these parameters showed a strong relationship with rates of mass gain. Our data confirm that the immediate ecological impact of the 1997-98 El Nino was not limited to the near-shore coastal margin, but extended far out into the North Pacific Ocean},

  abstract = {Underwater imagery (including video and still frame photos) are routinely collected with crewed and uncrewed submersible platforms and represent an unparalleled visual repository of knowledge about marine organisms and how they interact with their environment in a given spatiotemporal setting. Underwater images are of key importance for scientific analysis to inform policy and resource management decisions and are also in high demand for media and documentary releases. Underwater imagery requires accompanying metadata describing the contents of the imagery to achieve FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) guidelines. This essential metadata generation step is an intense - often manual - process requiring scientists to provide video annotations that are a prerequisite to achieving Open Science initiatives and ensuring that data are available for broad exploitation in standard or common formats. Unique data management challenges set underwater imagery apart from most other oceanographic and geophysical data collections. Consistently high data volumes coupled with rapidly evolving technical advances in sensors can exceed data processing, management, and user capabilities. These challenges often require unique storage and data access solutions. These concerns are compounded by imagery collected from previous sea-going expeditions. These historical data - often decades old - take on a new importance in the face of climate change, and represent an opportunity to evaluate - visually and quantitatively - change over time for a specific organism or location. It is necessary that these historically significant records are retained and equally available for comparative analysis. Through the past two decades, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has researched, implemented, and refined processes that support best data management practices at minimal cost. NOAA Ocean Exploration has sponsored hundreds of ocean exploration missions since its inception in 2001. Ongoing collaboration between NOAA Ocean Exploration, the NOAA Central Library and the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information has progressively defined best data management practices and developed tools to enhance user access to oceanographic data with a specific focus on underwater imagery. This collaboration resulted in a defined video metadata standard and a Video Data Management System to make analog video media available as a Library resource. Subsequently the Video Data Management Modernization Initiative modeled digital video access, based on entertainment industry standards which stored high resolution videos in deep storage with more easily accessible low-resolution proxies on spinning disk. Over the years, this model has been refined to manage imagery data of varying complexity as well as to leverage technological advancements to further improve data Fairness. We will offer an overview of several ongoing projects that leverage information technology advancements in cloud, artificial intelligence, machine and deep learning applications to benefit the imagery data analysis and management community by creating tools and algorithms in a crowd-sourced, open data manner. The capabilities of NOAA's imagery data management system have, and continues to, grown extensively thanks to broad collaboration with the larger ocean imagery data management and analysis community.},

  abstract = {The study of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during sleep in the spider monkey has provided new insights into primitive arboreal sleep physiology and behavior in anthropoids. Nevertheless, studies conducted to date have maintained the frequency ranges of the EEG bands commonly used with humans. The aim of the present work was to determine the EEG broad bands that characterize sleep and wakefulness in the spider monkey using principal component analysis (PCA). The EEG activity was recorded from the occipital, central, and frontal EEG derivations of six young-adult male spider monkeys housed in a laboratory setting. To determine which frequencies covaried and which were orthogonally independent during sleep and wakefulness, the power EEG spectra and interhemispheric and intrahemispheric EEG correlations from 1 to 30 Hz were subjected to PCA. Findings show that the EEG bands detection differed from those reported previously in both spider monkeys and humans, and that the 1--3 and 2--13 Hz frequency ranges concur with the oscillatory activity elucidated by cellular recordings of subcortical regions. Results show that applying PCA to the EEG spectrum during sleep and wakefulness in the spider monkey led to the identification of frequencies that covaried with, and were orthogonally independent of, other frequencies in each behavioral vigilance state. The new EEG bands differ from those used previously with both spider monkeys and humans. The 1--3 and 2--13 Hz frequency ranges are in accordance with the oscillatory activity elucidated by cellular recordings of subcortical regions in other mammals.},

However, there is no information regarding this EEG activity in the early stages of development in nonhuman primates. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe EEG sleep patterns in a 1-month-old Macaca arctoides with a non-invasive and free-movement method. Sleep stages were initially scored using the criteria of quiet sleep and active sleep. This procedure allowed us to observe graphoelements to distinguish sleep phases as described in adult macaques. Afterwards, the final score was recorded following the Slow Wave Sleep and Rapid Eye Movement Sleep criteria. The present results suggest that sleep features of this monkey are similar to those of a 2-month-old human neonate.},

  abstract = {Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an increasingly popular technology for studying brain function. NIRS presents several advantages relative to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), such as measurement of concentration changes in both oxygenated- and deoxygenated hemoglobin, finer temporal resolution, and ease of administration, as well as disadvantages, most prominently inferior spatial resolution and decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While fMRI has become the gold standard for in vivo imaging of the human brain, in practice NIRS is a more convenient and less expensive technology than fMRI. It is therefore of interest to many researchers how NIRS compares to fMRI in studies of brain function. In the present study we scanned participants with simultaneous NIRS and fMRI on a battery of cognitive tasks, placing NIRS probes over both frontal and parietal brain regions. We performed detailed comparisons of the signals in both temporal and spatial domains. We found that NIRS signals have significantly weaker SNR, but are nonetheless often highly correlated with fMRI measurements. Both SNR and the distance between the scalp and the brain contributed to variability in the NIRS/fMRI correlations. In the spatial domain, we found that a photon path forming an ellipse between the NIRS emitter and detector correlated most strongly with the BOLD response. Taken together these findings suggest that, while NIRS can be an appropriate substitute for fMRI for studying brain activity related to cognitive tasks, care should be taken when designing studies with NIRS to ensure that: 1) the spatial resolution is adequate for answering the question of interest and 2) the design accounts for weaker SNR, especially in brain regions more distal from the scalp.},

Dados de fontes de refer{\^e}ncias - Alguns trabalhos demonstraram esvaziamento g{\'a}strico lento, outros indicam que durante o sono REM o esvaziamento {\'e} r{\'a}pido. O ritmo da atividade motora intestinal {\'e} mais regular {\`a} noite do que durante o dia.

Objectives - In this revision we described the effect of sleep on the digestive system. Salivation, swallowing rate, upper esophageal sphincter pressure and number of primary esophageal contractions have all been shown to be reduced during sleep. Data sources - Gastric emptying is slow during sleep but the REM sleep is associated with faster gastric emptying. During the night we have a more regular intestinal motility than during the day. During sleep, phase II of the migrating motor complex cycle is virtually absent, both during diurnal or nocturnal sleep. The nocturnal velocity of migrating motor complex propagation in the proximal small bowel is slower than the diurnal velocity. The colon has a decrease in tonus and contractions. The anal canal pressure is lower and rectum activity is higher during sleep than during the awake state, but the anal pressure is still higher than the rectum pressure and the rectum contractions are most frequently retrograde. Data synthesis - Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation is the most frequent cause of gastroesophageal reflux. The frequency of this transient relaxation is very low during sleep. Gastroesophageal reflux during sleep is more frequently associated with a low lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Conclusions - In this situation the disease is worse because the patient is in the supine position, so gravity does not help the acid esophageal clearance, salivation is decreased and the primary esophageal contraction is not frequent, a fact causing a prolongation of acid clearance during sleep. The right lateral position during sleep causes more reflux episodes than the left lateral position. The gastroesophageal reflux may be associated with nocturnal wheezing, chronic nocturnal cough and sleep apnea.},

  abstract = {Evaluation methodologies in visualization have mostly focused on how well the tools and techniques cater to the analytical needs of the user. While this is important in determining the effectiveness of the tools and advancing the state-of-the-art in visualization research, a key area that has mostly been overlooked is how well established visualization theories and principles are instantiated in practice. This is especially relevant when domain experts, and not visualization researchers, design visualizations for analysis of their data or for broader dissemination of scientific knowledge. There is very little research on exploring the synergistic capabilities of cross-domain collaboration between domain experts and visualization researchers. To fill this gap, in this paper we describe the results of an exploratory study of climate data visualizations conducted in tight collaboration with a pool of climate scientists. The study analyzes a large set of static climate data visualizations for identifying their shortcomings in terms of visualization design. The outcome of the study is a classification scheme that categorizes the design problems in the form of a descriptive taxonomy. The taxonomy is a first attempt for systematically categorizing the types, causes, and consequences of design problems in visualizations created by domain experts. We demonstrate the use of the taxonomy for a number of purposes, such as, improving the existing climate data visualizations, reflecting on the impact of the problems for enabling domain experts in designing better visualizations, and also learning about the gaps and opportunities for future visualization research. We demonstrate the applicability of our taxonomy through a number of examples and discuss the lessons learnt and implications of our findings.},

Because the term ``data-driven policing'' encompasses a broad swath of technologies, we first outline several data-driven policing initiatives currently in use in the United States. We then lay out the five ethical challenges. Certain of these challenges have received considerable attention already, while others have been largely overlooked. In many cases, the challenges have been articulated in the context of related discussions, but their distinctively ethical dimensions have not been explored in much detail. Our goal here is to articulate and clarify these ethical challenges, while also highlighting areas where these issues intersect and overlap. Ultimately, responsible data-driven policing requires collaboration between communities, academics, technology developers, police departments, and policy makers to confront and address these challenges. And as we will see, it may also require critically reexamining the role and value of police in society.},

  abstract = {We attached a video system and data recorder to a northern elephant seal to track its three-dimensional movements and observe propulsive strokes of the hind flippers. During 6 h of recording, the seal made 20 dives and spent 90\% of the time submerged. Average dive duration, maximum depth and swimming speed were 14.9 min {\textpm} 6.1 S.D., 289 m {\textpm} 117 S.D. and 1.1 m s-1 {\textpm} 0.12 S.D., respectively. The distance swum during a dive averaged 925 m {\textpm} 339 S.D., and the average descent and ascent angles were 41{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 18 S.D. and 50{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 21 S.D., respectively. Dive paths were remarkably straight suggesting that the seal was navigating while submerged. We identified three modes of swimming based on the interval between propulsive strokes: continuous stroking; stroke-and-glide swimming; and prolonged gliding. The seal used continuous stroking from the surface to a mean depth of 20 m followed by stroke-and-glide swimming. Prolonged gliding started at a mean depth of 60 m and continued to the bottom of dives. For dives to depths of 300 m or more, 75\% of the descent time was spent in prolonged gliding and 10\% in stroke-and-glide swimming, amounting to 5.9-9.6 min of passive descent per dive. Average swimming speed varied little with swimming mode and was not a good indicator of propulsive effort. It appears that the seal can use prolonged gliding to reduce the cost of transport and increase dive duration. Energetically efficient locomotion may help explain the long and deep dives that routinely exceed the theoretical aerobic dive limit in this species. {\copyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

  abstract = {We attached a video system and data recorder to a northern elephant seal to track its three-dimensional movements and observe propulsive strokes of the hind flippers. During 6 h of recording, the seal made 20 dives and spent 90\% of the time submerged. Average dive duration, maximum depth and swimming speed were 14.9 min " 6.1 S.D., 289 m" 117 S.D. and 1.1 m sy1 " 0.12 S.D., respectively. The distance swum during a dive averaged 925 m" 339 S.D., and the average descent and ascent angles were 41{\cyrchar\CYRNJE} " 18 S.D. and 50{\cyrchar\CYRNJE} " 21 S.D., respectively. Dive paths were remarkably straight suggesting that the seal was navigating while submerged. We identified three modes of swimming based on the interval between propulsive strokes: continuous stroking; stroke-and-glide swimming; and prolonged gliding. The seal used continuous stroking from the surface to a mean depth of 20 m followed by stroke-and-glide swimming. Prolonged gliding started at a mean depth of 60 m and continued to the bottom of dives. For dives to depths of 300 m or more, 75\% of the descent time was spent in prolonged gliding and 10\% in stroke-and-glide swimming, amounting to 5.9᎐9.6 min of passive descent per dive. Average swimming speed varied little with swimming mode and was not a good indicator of propulsive effort. It appears that the seal can use prolonged gliding to reduce the cost of transport and increase dive duration. Energetically efficient locomotion may help explain the long and deep dives that routinely exceed the theoretical aerobic dive limit in this species. ᮊ 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

  abstract = {The definition of what sleep is depends on the method that is applied to record sleep. Behavioral and (electro)-physiological measures of sleep clearly overlap in mammals and birds , but it is often unclear how these two relate in other vertebrates and invertebrates. Homeostatic regulation of sleep, where the amount of sleep depends on the amount of previous waking, can be observed in physiology and behavior in all animals this was tested in. In mammals and birds, sleep is generally subdivided into two states, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and REM sleep. In mammals the combination of behavioral sleep and the changes in the slow-wave range of the NREM sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) can explain and predict the occurrence and depth of sleep in great detail. For REM sleep this is far less clear. Finally, the discovery that slow-waves in the NREM sleep EEG are influenced locally on the cortex depending on prior waking behavior is an interesting new development that asks for an adaptation of the concept of homeostatic regulation of sleep. Incorporating local sleep into models of sleep regulation is needed to obtain a comprehensive picture.},

Here, we combine datasets derived from sustained ocean observing systems (satellite and in situ), idealized observation-based modelling (advection-diffusion of a passive tracer), and a machine learning technique (ocean profile clustering) to document and explain the most-recent and ongoing cooling-to-warming transition of the Subpolar North Atlantic. Following a gradual cooling of the region that was persisting since 2006, a surface-intensified and large-scale warming sharply emerged in 2016 following an ocean circulation shift that enhanced the northeastward penetration of warm and saline waters from the western subtropics. The long ocean memory of the Subpolar North Atlantic implies that this advection-driven warming is likely to persist in the near-future with possible implications for the Atlantic multidecadal variability and its global impacts.},

Recently, attention has turned to correlates of more flexible, albeit computationally complex, model-based methods in the brain. These methods are distinguished from model-free learning by their evaluation of candidate actions using expected future outcomes according to a world model. Puzzlingly, signatures from these computations seem to be pervasive in the very same regions previously thought to support model-free learning. Here, we review recent behavioral and neural evidence about these two systems, in attempt to reconcile their enigmatic cohabitation in the brain.},

  abstract = {Deficits in daytime performance due to sleep loss are experienced universally and associated with a significant social, financial, and human cost. Microsleeps, sleep attacks, and lapses in cognition increase with sleep loss as a function of state instability. Sleep deprivation studies repeatedly show a variable (negative) impact on mood, cognitive performance, and motor function due to an increasing sleep propensity and destabilization of the wake state. Specific neurocognitive domains including executive attention, working memory, and divergent higher cognitive functions are particularly vulnerable to sleep loss. In humans, functional metabolic and neurophysiological studies demonstrate that neural systems involved in executive function (i.e., prefrontal cortex) are more susceptible to sleep deprivation in some individuals than others. Recent chronic partial sleep deprivation experiments, which more closely replicate sleep loss in society, demonstrate that profound neurocognitive deficits accumulate over time in the face of subjective adaptation to the sensation of sleepiness. Sleep deprivation associated with disease-related sleep fragmentation (i.e., sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome) also results in neurocognitive performance decrements similar to those seen in sleep restriction studies. Performance deficits associated with sleep disorders are often viewed as a simple function of disease severity; however, recent experiments suggest that individual vulnerability to sleep loss may play a more critical role than previously thought.},

The purpose of this paper is to perform a systematic review of the literature on the smart fishery and to identify upcoming themes for future research on the sustainable fishery in the Age of AI. The findings of the review reveal that scholarly attention in AI-inspired fishery literature focuses mostly on automation of fishery resources monitoring, mainly detection, identification, and classification. Some papers list marine health and primary production which are vital dimensions for Large Marine Ecosystems to recycle nutrients to sustain anticipated production levels. Very few reviewed articles refer to assessing individual needs, particularly fishers, from AI deployment in fisheries and policy response from governments. We call for future AI for sustainable fishery studies on how fishers perceive AI needs, and how governments possess a tangible strategy or depth of understanding on the regulation of AI concerning smart fishery systems and research on resilience-enhancing policies to promote the value and potentials of the AI-inspired smart fishery in different locations.},

These defenses are mutually exclusive, since a prey cannot simultaneously flee and fight, or freeze and flee. Each of these defenses by itself is rudimentary and probably cannot provide a completely effective means to elude predation. Freezing is efficient only if employed before the prey is spotted by the predator, otherwise the prey becomes a stationary, easy to catch target. In fleeing, the prey can move directly away and maximize its distance from the predator, move toward the predator to confine it to a single clashing point, or dodge sideways to evade the attack. Prey can also run in a straight path that is efficient against slow or distant predators, or in a zigzag path that is efficient when a raptor is close or fast. In all, freezing and fleeing constitute together a complex and flexible defensive response, and are probably controlled by different motor systems that are inter-connected to allow fast switching between these behaviors, as required for an effective and versatile response. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The time spent in quiet sleep was negatively correlated with body size and basal metabolic rate. The latter relationship remained even after controlling for the effects of body weight. Neither the total time spent in active sleep, nor active sleep as a percentage of total sleep time was significantly correlated with body weight or metabolic rate. Altricial species spend more time in active sleep than do precocial species. The time between the onset of successive episodes of active sleep, the AS-QS cycle length, was positively correlated with body weight. For their body sizes, species that live in temperate regions have shorter AS-QS cycles than those living in tropical or sub-tropical regions. Correlations between patterns of sleep and adult brain weight probably result from the confounding effects of body weight. These findings were used to evaluate several explanations for interspecific differences in patterns of sleep among mammals. {\copyright} 1988.},

  abstract = {Given the crucial role the ocean plays in human and planetary health, ocean literacy (OL)---understanding the ocean's influence on us and our influence on the ocean---has been gaining momentum as a significant component and determinant of sustainable human-ocean interactions. Underwater virtual reality (UVR) enables participants to take a virtual dive while being simultaneously immersed in water. Through this unique double immersion, UVR is offering new avenues of psychological access and pedagogical opportunities toward the ocean; this study is thus the first to explore UVR's potential for OL and marine environmental education. Following two UVR activities in a pool, we conducted semi-structured interviews and survey questionnaires with 19 marine scientists and education experts. Our findings indicate UVR has important technological and psychological potentials, including (1) high levels of presence, (2) infrequency of motion sickness, and (3) the ability to trigger powerful emotions and affective states such as awe, empathy, and flow. In this way, UVR can create a realistic experience of the ocean that improves OL and reduces psychological distance to marine environmental issues. We also advance a new seven-dimensional OL framework, following our findings that UVR has unique potentials for improving `emoceans', attitude, awareness, and ocean connectedness.},

This aspect of seal physiology has received much less attention than has the ability to dive for extended periods and yet is important to the context in which dive-related morphological and physiological specializations are considered. We found, in seals exercising in the laboratory, that as [Formula: see text] increased, heart rate during breathing bouts was high and unchanging. Heart rate during dives was 25 to 33\% of the rate during breathing and was insensitive to metabolic rate. However, the fraction of time seals spent breathing and overall average heart rate increased with exercise. We have confirmed these patterns using very high frequency and acoustic telemetry in freely diving harbour seals in the open sea. Heart rate at the surface was virtually constant at 120{\enspace}beats/min and independent of dive duration. While the seals were diving, heart rate fell to 40{\enspace}beats/min. Average heart rate depended almost entirely on the proportion of time spent below the surface and only to a minor extent on dive length. The exceedingly low heart rates seen during forced dives in the laboratory were never observed at sea.},

It is, however, still controversial if SWS amount is only a function of prior waking duration, or if it is related to the structure of the previous sleep period (i.e., to the time spent in SWS). In order to clarify if the amount of SWS is crucial in determining SWS recovery, we selectively deprived SWS during two nights to assess the presence of a compensatory SWS rebound in the following recovery night. Ten normal males slept for 6 consecutive nights in the laboratory. After an adaptation and two baseline nights (BSL; BSL-A), selective SWS deprivation was accomplished for two consecutive nights (DEP-1; DEP-2), by means of an acoustic stimulation technique. A recovery (REC) night then followed. An almost complete selective SWS suppression during both deprivation nights was achieved. A significant increase of S4 and SWS in the REC as compared to the BSL-A paralleled a significant shortening of S3 and S4 latencies. S2 percentage significantly increased during both DEP nights with respect to the other experimental nights. There was no significant difference among nights with regard to total sleep time, percentage of REM sleep, stage 1, movement time, number of awakenings and number of movement arousals, indicating that the acoustic stimulation technique did not dramatically disrupt normal sleep continuity and architecture. These results indicate that SWS rebound after selective SWS deprivation can be ascribed to the loss of SWS accumulated during two consecutive nights, further supporting the idea that the delta sleep amount is more linked to SWS in the previous sleep periods than to the total sleep duration.},

  abstract = {Marine mammals live, feed, and reproduce in a vast, three-dimensional fluid environment-the ocean. Air-breathing necessitates frequent attendance to the sea surface for all marine mammals, whereas pinnipeds cannot reproduce in the water and have thus retained a close tie to land or ice. Despite these ties to the boundaries of the ocean environment, oceanography is an important part of the study of marine mammals. Habitat and distribution of marine mammals are affected by the physical and chemical properties of the water through which they swim and communicate, the topography of the ocean bottom where they feed, the physical state of the ocean surface where they breathe and haul out, and numerous factors influencing the distribution of food organisms. Biological productivity is the rate of production of living matter. Primary productivity in the ocean is the rate of production of plants (phytoplankton), and is often limited by light and nutrient availability, both of which are controlled by physical oceanographic processes. Nutrient availability is affected by oceanographic processes that includes stratification, wind and tidal mixing, circulation, and upwelling. However, marine mammals live and breed in the polar ice and even small young harp seals are able to tolerate freezing temperatures. Direct effects of temperature increase are unlikely for most marine mammals, because of their mobility and thermoregulatory ability. However, direct effects could occur for populations at the limits of their range or with physical limits to migration that preclude distribution shifts to track environmental changes. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Background. This study compares the morphology and cytology of olfactory organs in moray eels (Muraenidae), particularly Siderea grisea and some species of the genera Echidna, Gymnothorax, and Lycodontis, fishes that are top predators in shallow-water marine habitats. Some of the species search visually for food while others search by olfaction. Methods. The morays were collected in the Red Sea; the nasal olfactory organs were dissected and fixed in Bouin's solution for light-microscopy, and 3.5\% glutaraldehyde for electron-microscopy studies. Results. In each studied species the olfactory rosettes are elongated structures situated in closed olfactory chambers between anterior tubular inlet nares and slit-form posterior outlet openings. The double row of lamellae constituting these rosettes are round in Siderea and Echidna and elongated in the other species. They are attached at their base to a median raphe and range in number from 20 in the youngest observed Siderea to 168 in Gymnothorax of 1,500 mm total length. As in other teleosts, the lamellae are covered by a ciliated epithelium composed of three types of sensory cells: two of these, ciliated sensory neurons and ciliated supporting cells, differ in detail, length, and thickness of their cilia and intracellular rootlet system; the third type of sensory cells bears microvillae as well as cilia. Proximal, axonal extensions of the ciliated cells cross the basal lamina in bundles and combine to form fila olfactoria from which the two olfactory nerves extend towards the olfactory bulbs. Lateral extensions at the basal parts of these ciliated cells, the so-called spines, cross the membranes of neighboring cells as dendrites, possibly changing part or an of the ciliated epithelium into an olfactory field. The density and number of sensory cells on the lamellae, as well as observed differences in their foraging behavior in nature and captivity, enable the morays to be divided into two groups: one group, in which the lamellae are richly covered with stereocilia, includes species of the genera Siderea and Echidna, that search for food by olfaction, and the second group, which has a great deal less cells with stereocilia and includes the studies species of Gymnothorax and Lycodontis, locates its food visually.},

These two foraging types were also found to differ in ratios of mouth length and eye diameter to total body length and of longest-tooth length to mouth length. The macrosmatic morays have smaller eyes, and shorter mouths and teeth. These differences probably reflect partitioning of habitat and food niches among the various moray eel species.},

Here we used accelerometers to detect rapid head movements during prey encounter events (PEE) of free-ranging benthic-divers, Australian fur seals, Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus. PEE signals from accelerometer data were validated by simultaneous video data. We then used PEEs as a measure of patch quality to test several optimal foraging model predictions. Seals had longer bottom durations in unfruitful dives (no PEE) than those with some foraging success (PEE. {$\geq$}. 1). However, when examined in greater detail, seals had longer bottom durations in dives with more PEEs, but shorter bottom durations in bouts (sequences of dives) with more PEEs. Our results suggest that seals were generally maximizing bottom durations in all foraging dives, characteristic of benthic divers. However, successful foraging dives might be more energetically costly (e.g. digestive costs), thus resulting in shorter bottom durations at the larger scale of bouts. Our study provides a case study of how the foraging behaviour of a central place forager foraging in a fairly homogeneous environment, with relatively high travel costs, may deviate from current foraging models under different situations. Future foraging models should aim to integrate other aspects (e.g. diet) of the foraging process for more accurate predictions.},

These motor and respiratory patterns resemble the phasic motor/respiratory components of adult REM sleep, and as a consequence, this sleep state is traditionally viewed as an immature form of REM sleep. An alternative view is that a significant portion of what has been called REM sleep in these species is a form of spontaneous activity typical of the immature nervous system. In this review, we compare and contrast these two opposing views about the ontogenetic origins of REM sleep, and review the evidence most often cited to support the idea that REM sleep is present in newborn altricial mammals. Critical review of this evidence indicates that REM sleep may not be present at birth in these species; rather, it appears that all mammals early in development exhibit spontaneous, dissociated activity that progressively becomes organized into the distinct states of REM and non-rapid eye movement sleep.},

  abstract = {Although sleep is ubiquitous, its evolutionary purpose remains elusive. Though every species of animal, as well as many plants sleep, theories of its origin are purely physiological, e.g. to conserve energy, make repairs or to consolidate learning. An evolutionary reason for sleep would answer one of biology's fundamental unanswered questions. When environmental conditions change on a periodic basis (winter/summer, day/night) organisms must somehow confront the change or else be less able to compete in either niche. Seasonal adaptation includes the migration of birds, changes in honeybee physiology and winter abscission in plants. Diurnal adaptation must be more rapid, forcing changes in behavior in addition to physiology. Since organisms must exist in both environments, evolution has created a way to force a change in behavior, in effect creating ``different'' organisms (one awake, one asleep) adapted separately to two distinct niches. We sleep to allow evolving into two competing niches. The physiology of sleep forces a change to a different state for the second niche. The physiological needs for sleep are mechanisms that have evolved to achieve this goal.},

  abstract = {Many species of typically diurnal songbirds experience sleep loss during the migratory seasons owing to their nocturnal migrations. However, despite substantial loss of sleep, nocturnally migrating songbirds continue to function normally with no observable effect on their behaviour. It is unclear if and how avian migrants compensate for sleep loss. Recent behavioural evidence suggests that some species may compensate for lost night-time sleep with short, uni- and bilateral `micro-naps' during the day. We provide electrophysiological evidence that short episodes of sleep-like daytime behaviour (approx. 12{$\mkern1mu$}s) are accompanied by sleep-like changes in brain activity in an avian migrant. Furthermore, we present evidence that part of this physiological brain response manifests itself as unihemispheric sleep, a state during which one brain hemisphere is asleep while the other hemisphere remains essentially awake. Episodes of daytime sleep may represent a potent adaptation to the challenges of avian migration and offer a plausible explanation for the resilience to sleep loss in nocturnal migrants.},

Point Reyes Peninsula, California, is one location where population increase has resulted in colony expansion. Initial models identified suitable breeding haul-outs and suggested that human disturbance, geomorphology, mean wave height, and slope were important explanatory variables. Three sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios were run, which indicated that most current and potential haul-out sites would largely be inundated by 2050. Because the Point Reyes coast has limited suitable habitat for the seals to colonize, conservation measures may guide management responses to SLR. The resulting analyses can be used to better understand local-scale seal responses to SLR and contribute to effective management of pinnipeds within Point Reyes National Seashore and elsewhere.

  abstract = {Coastal flooding affects low-lying communities worldwide and is expected to increase with climate change, especially along reef-lined coasts, where wave-driven flooding is particularly prevalent. However, current regional modeling approaches are either insufficient or too computationally expensive to accurately assess risks in these complex environments. This study introduces and validates an improved computationally efficient and physics-based approach to compute dynamic wave-driven regional flooding on reef-lined coasts. We coupled a simplified-physics flood model (SFINCS) with a one-dimensional wave transformation model (XBeach-1D). To assess the performance of the proposed approach, we compared its results with results from a fully resolving two-dimensional wave transformation model (XBeach-2D). We applied this approach for a range of storms and sea-level rise scenarios for two contrasting reef-lined coastal geomorphologies: one low relief area and one high relief area. Our findings reveal that SFINCS coupled with XBeach-1D generates flood extents comparable to those produced by XBeach-2D, with a hit rate of 92\%. However, this method tends to underpredict the flood extent of weaker, high-frequency storms and overpredict stronger, low-frequency storms. Across scenarios, our approach overpredicted the mean flood water depth, with a positive bias of 7 cm and root mean square difference of 15 cm. Offering approximately 100 times greater computational efficiency than its two-dimensional XBeach counterpart, this flood modeling technique is recommended for wave-driven flood modeling in scenarios with high computational demands, such as modeling numerous scenarios or undertaking detailed regional-scale modeling.},

  abstract = {The vast majority of drugs entering human trials fail. This problem (called "attrition") is widely recognized as a public health crisis, and has been discussed openly for the last two decades. Multiple recent reviews argue that animals may be just too different physiologically, anatomically, and psychologically from humans to be able to predict human outcomes, essentially questioning the justification of basic biomedical research in animals. This review argues instead that the philosophy and practice of experimental design and analysis is so different in basic animal work and human clinical trials that an animal experiment (as currently conducted) cannot reasonably predict the outcome of a human trial. Thus, attrition does reflect a lack of predictive validity of animal experiments, but it would be a tragic mistake to conclude that animal models cannot show predictive validity. A variety of contributing factors to poor validity are reviewed. The need to adopt methods and models that are highly specific (i.e., which can identify true negative results) in order to complement the current preponderance of highly sensitive methods (which are prone to false positive results) is emphasized. Concepts in biomarker-based medicine are offered as a potential solution, and changes in the use of animal models required to embrace a translational biomarker-based approach are outlined. In essence, this review advocates a fundamental shift, where we treat every aspect of an animal experiment that we can as if it was a clinical trial in a human population. However, it is unrealistic to expect researchers to adopt a new methodology that cannot be empirically justified until a successful human trial. "Validation with known failures" is proposed as a solution. Thus new methods or models can be compared against existing ones using a drug that has translated (a known positive) and one that has failed (a known negative). Current methods should incorrectly identify both as effective, but a more specific method should identify the negative compound correctly. By using a library of known failures we can thereby empirically test the impact of suggested solutions such as enrichment, controlled heterogenization, biomarker-based models, or reverse-translated measures.},

While functional parallels have been described relating to both affective (e.g., emotion processing) and cognitive (e.g., memory consolidation) domains, methodologically relevant questions about the reliability of sleep stage scoring still need to be addressed. In Study 1, we analyzed the effects of different coders and different numbers of visible EEG channels on the visual scoring of the same polysomnography recordings. The lowest agreement was found between independent coders with different scoring experience using full (3 h-long) recordings of the whole dataset, and the highest agreement within-coder, using only a fraction of the original dataset (randomly selected 100 epochs (i.e., 100 {\texttimes} 20 s long segments)). The identification of drowsiness was found to be the least reliable, while that of non-REM (rapid eye movement, NREM) was the most reliable. Disagreements resulted in no or only moderate differences in macrostructural and spectral variables. Study 2 targeted the task of automated sleep EEG time series classification. Supervised machine learning (ML) models were used to help the manual annotation process by reliably predicting if the dog was sleeping or awake. Logistic regression models (LogREG), gradient boosted trees (GBT) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) were set up and trained for sleep state prediction from already collected and manually annotated EEG data.

The method involved a careful search during two passages over transects by day and by night, noting size and position of morays seen, and using the number of new observations on the second passage to estimate the proportion of morays not seen. First passage counts were generally higher than numbers of morays recorded in previous visual censuses. These estimates were raised when we used the time period (day or night) with the highest average density visible for each species, added different individuals from the two passages, and corrected for individuals not seen. We saw more goldentail morays (Gymnothorax miliaris) during the day but more spotted (G. moringa), viper (Enchelycore nigricans), and chestnut (E. carychroa) morays at night. Counts of chain morays (Echidna catenata) did not differ significantly between night and day. Relative abundance and size of moray species varied among sites and to a lesser extent among habitat types within sites, but spotted morays were generally the most important in numbers and biomass. Mean estimated moray density and biomass were much higher than in most previous visual censuses, but similar to rotenone samples on other reefs and comparable to those of other families of predatory fishes. Our findings confirm that morays are abundant and potentially important predators that should be the focus of more attention in ecological studies of coral reefs.},

  abstract = {Understanding the diet of deep-diving predators can provide essential insight to the trophic structure of the mesopelagic ecosystem. Comprehensive population-level diet estimates are exceptionally difficult to obtain for elusive marine predators due to the logistical challenges involved in observing their feeding behavior and collecting samples for traditional stomach content or fecal analyses. We used quantitative fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA) to estimate the diet composition of a wide-ranging mesopelagic predator, the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), across five years. To implement QFASA, we first compiled a library of prey fatty acid (FA) profiles from the mesopelagic eastern North Pacific. Given the scarcity of a priori diet data for northern elephant seals, our prey library was necessarily large to encompass the range of potential prey in their foraging habitat. However, statistical constraints limit the number of prey species that can be included in the prey library to the number of dietary FAs in the analysis. Exceeding that limit could produce non-unique diet estimates (i.e., multiple diet estimates fit the data equally well). Consequently, we developed a novel ad-hoc method to identify which prey were unlikely to contribute to diet and could, therefore, be excluded from the final QFASA model. The model results suggest that seals predominantly consumed small mesopelagic fishes, including myctophids (lanternfishes) and bathylagids (deep sea smelts), while non-migrating mesopelagic squids comprised a third of their diet, substantially less than suggested by previous studies.

  abstract = {Dolphin sleep is unlike typical mammalian sleep in that slow wave sleep occurs in one hemisphere at a time and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is apparently reduced or absent (Mukhametov 1987). Lilly (1964) observed that bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) sleep with one eye open and one eye closed and suggested that the open eye monitored the immediate area for predators. Mukhametov (1987) and Supin et al. (1978) found no physiological correlation between the active brain hemisphere and the open eye, and suggested that no sentinel function exists. I describe the behavioral and social aspects of sleep in a captive school of four Pacific white-sided dolphins (LAgenorbyncbus obliquidens) at Long Marine Lab at the University of California at Santa Crut for 32 nights. As the animals swam in formation, I recorded their positions and eye condition. Dolphins did not close their eyes or switch positions in the school randomly. While in formation, dolphins switched positions in bouts while concurrently changing eye condition. This resulted in a sleeping formation in which the dolphins likely had the eye open towards schoolmates, not toward the external environment. I suggest that this allows sleep to proceed while allowing dolphins to maintain visual contact with group members.},

Such buoyancy changes can be monitored by measuring changes in the rate at which a seal drifts passively through the water column, i.e. when all active swimming motion ceases. Here, we present an improved knowledge-based method for detecting buoyancy changes from compressed and abstracted dive profiles received through telemetry. By step-wise filtering of the dive data, the developed algorithm identifies fragments of dives that correspond to times when animals drift. In the dive records of 11 southern elephant seals from South Georgia, this filtering method identified 0.8--2.2\% of all dives as drift dives, indicating large individual variation in drift diving behaviour. The obtained drift rate time series exhibit that, at the beginning of each migration, all individuals were strongly negatively buoyant. Over the following 75--150 days, the buoyancy of all individuals peaked close to or at neutral buoyancy, indicative of a seal's foraging success. Independent verification with visually inspected detailed high-resolution dive data confirmed that this method is capable of reliably detecting buoyancy changes in the dive records of drift diving species using abstracted data. This also affirms that abstracted dive profiles convey the geometric shape of drift dives in sufficient detail for them to be identified. Further, it suggests that, using this step-wise filtering method, buoyancy changes could be detected even in old datasets with compressed dive information, for which conventional drift dive classification previously failed.},

Focal specific paroxysmal discharges (SPDs) were present in 10 patients (38\%) in the shunted group in contrast to only two (10\%) in the non-shunted group. Focal SPDs and slow waves were seen most frequently over the shunted hemisphere in the shunted group. The prevalence of seizures was significantly greater in the shunted group (20\% in the non-shunted, 48\% in the shunted group).

We found that these two elephants were polyphasic sleepers, had an average daily total sleep time of 2 h, mostly between 02:00 and 06:00, and displayed the shortest daily sleep time of any mammal recorded to date. Moreover, these two elephants exhibited both standing and recumbent sleep, but only exhibited recumbent sleep every third or fourth day, potentially limiting their ability to enter REM sleep on a daily basis. In addition, we observed on five occasions that the elephants went without sleep for up to 46 h and traversed around 30 km in 10 h, possibly due to disturbances such as potential predation or poaching events, or a bull elephant in musth. They exhibited no form of sleep rebound following a night without sleep. Environmental conditions, especially ambient air temperature and relative humidity, analysed as wet-bulb globe temperature, reliably predict sleep onset and offset times. The elephants selected novel sleep sites each night and the amount of activity between sleep periods did not affect the amount of sleep. A number of similarities and differences to studies of elephant sleep in captivity are noted, and specific factors shaping sleep architecture in elephants, on various temporal scales, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Wild mammals are icons of conservation efforts, yet there is no rigorous estimate available for their overall global biomass. Biomass as a metric allows us to compare species with very different body sizes, and can serve as an indicator of wild mammal presence, trends, and impacts, on a global scale. Here, we compiled estimates of the total abundance (i.e., the number of individuals) of several hundred mammal species from the available data, and used these to build a model that infers the total biomass of terrestrial mammal species for which the global abundance is unknown. We present a detailed assessment, arriving at a total wet biomass of {$\approx$}20 million tonnes (Mt) for all terrestrial wild mammals (95\% CI 13-38 Mt), i.e., {$\approx$}3 kg per person on earth. The primary contributors to the biomass of wild land mammals are large herbivores such as the white-tailed deer, wild boar, and African elephant. We find that even-hoofed mammals (artiodactyls, such as deer and boars) represent about half of the combined mass of terrestrial wild mammals. In addition, we estimated the total biomass of wild marine mammals at {$\approx$}40 Mt (95\% CI 20-80 Mt), with baleen whales comprising more than half of this mass. In order to put wild mammal biomass into perspective, we additionally estimate the biomass of the remaining members of the class Mammalia. The total mammal biomass is overwhelmingly dominated by livestock ({$\approx$}630 Mt) and humans ({$\approx$}390 Mt). This work is a provisional census of wild mammal biomass on Earth and can serve as a benchmark for human impacts.},

This is equivalent to an average uptake rate of 2.6 {\textpm} 0.3 Pg C year-1 and represents 31 {\textpm} 4\% of the global anthropogenic CO2 emissions over this period. Although this global ocean sink estimate is consistent with the expectation of the ocean uptake having increased in proportion to the rise in atmospheric CO2, substantial regional differences in storage rate are found, likely owing to climate variability--driven changes in ocean circulation.},

  abstract = {Research in both ecology and AI strives for predictive understanding of complex systems, where nonlinearities arise from multidimensional interactions and feedbacks across multiple scales. After a century of independent, asynchronous advances in computational and ecological research, we foresee a critical need for intentional synergy to meet current societal challenges against the backdrop of global change. These challenges include understanding the unpredictability of systems-level phenomena and resilience dynamics on a rapidly changing planet. Here, we spotlight both the promise and the urgency of a convergence research paradigm between ecology and AI. Ecological systems are a challenge to fully and holistically model, even using the most prominent AI technique today: deep neural networks. Moreover, ecological systems have emergent and resilient behaviors that may inspire new, robust AI architectures and methodologies. We share examples of how challenges in ecological systems modeling would benefit from advances in AI techniques that are themselves inspired by the systems they seek to model. Both fields have inspired each other, albeit indirectly, in an evolution toward this convergence. We emphasize the need for more purposeful synergy to accelerate the understanding of ecological resilience whilst building the resilience currently lacking in modern AI systems, which have been shown to fail at times because of poor generalization in different contexts. Persistent epistemic barriers would benefit from attention in both disciplines. The implications of a successful convergence go beyond advancing ecological disciplines or achieving an artificial general intelligence---they are critical for both persisting and thriving in an uncertain future.},

  abstract = {Bats, quoted as sleeping for up to 20 h a day, are an often used example of extreme sleep duration amongst mammals. Given that duration has historically been one of the primary metrics featured in comparative studies of sleep, it is important that species specific sleep durations are well founded. Here, we re-examined the evidence for the characterization of bats as extreme sleepers and discuss whether it provides a useful representation of the sleep behavior of Chiroptera. Although there are a wealth of activity data to suggest that the diurnal cycle of bats is dominated by rest, estimates of sleep time generated from electrophysiological analyses suggest considerable interspecific variation, ranging from 83\% to a more moderate 61\% of the 24 h day spent asleep. Temperature-dependent changes in the duration and electroencephalographic profile of sleep suggest that bats represent a unique model for investigating the relationship between sleep and torpor. Further sources of intra-specific variation in sleep duration, including the impact of artificial laboratory environments and sleep intensity, remain unexplored. Future studies conducted in naturalistic environments, using larger sample sizes and relying on a pre-determined set of defining criteria will undoubtedly provide novel insights into sleep in bats and other species.},

The frequency detected in the EEG of dolphin during apparent awakening was divided conveniently into three bands (5-15, 15-25, and 25-40 Hz) based on spectrum profiles. Analyses of the relationship between power ratio and movement of the dolphin revealed that the power ratio of dolphin in a situation when it was being quiet was evenly distributed among the three bands. These results suggested that the EEG of a dolphin could be detected accurately by this method, and that the frequency analysis of the detected EEG seemed to provide useful information for understanding the central nerve activity of these animals.},

We measured body oxygen stores (blood volume and muscle myoglobin) and diving behavior in adult female northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris, to investigate age-related effects on diving performance. Blood volume averaged 74.4{\textpm}17.0 liters in female elephant seals or 20.2{\textpm}2.0\% of body mass. Plasma volume averaged 32.2{\textpm}7.8 liters or 8.7{\textpm}0.7\% of body mass. Absolute plasma volume and blood volume increased independently with mass and age. Hematocrit decreased weakly with mass but did not vary with age. Muscle myoglobin concentration, while higher than previously reported (7.4{\textpm}0.7 g\%), did not vary with mass or age. Pregnancy status did not influence blood volume. Mean dive duration, a proxy for physiological demand, increased as a function of how long seals had been at sea, followed by mass and hematocrit. Strong effects of female body mass (range, 218-600 kg) on dive duration, which were independent of oxygen stores, suggest that larger females had lower diving metabolic rates. A tendency for dives to exceed calculated aerobic limits occurred more frequently later in the at-sea migration. Our data suggest that individual physiological state variables and condition interact to determine breath-hold ability and that both should be considered in life-history studies of foraging behavior.},

Swimming speed significantly reduced the dive duration and time at depth for presumed foraging dives, but increased with dive depth. This suggests that the extended duration of deep dives is made possible by physiological adjustments and not by changes in swimming speed or effort. Swimming speeds were similar across sex and age classes despite different predicted minimum cost of transport speeds. All seals exhibited characteristic dive shapes and swimming speed patterns that support their putative functions, but two-dimensional dive shapes and swimming angles varied between sexes and age classes. Mean dive angles on descent were markedly shallow, suggesting use of negative buoyancy to cover horizontal distance while diving. Buoyancy also appeared to affect two-dimensional dive shapes and ability to use extended gliding behaviours between surface and deep foraging zones. Significant differences in diving behaviour between sexes and between young and adult females were evident for various phases of the dive cycle, potentially resulting from physical constraints or differences in dive functionality. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: We studied eight men with moderate to severe OSA by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) simultaneously with polysomnography during nocturnal sleep (five patients) and daytime naps (three). Results: In all patients, a consistent decrease of oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) and increases of deoxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin (TotalHb) in the regional cerebral tissue were observed during the episode of OSA at every sleep stage. Changes in each hemoglobin and apnea duration were significantly (p{$<$}0.01) more remarkable during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep than non-REM (NREM) sleep. Significant correlations of changes in OxyHb and TotalHb during the apneic episode with apnea duration were found during both NBEM and REM sleep (p{$<$}0.01). Conclusions: Since TotalHb is used as an indicator of blood volume in the NIRS technique and the venous return is reported to increase during OSA, it is assumed that cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases during the episode of OSA. Because a decrease in OxyHb was observed and brain activity is reported to decrease during OSA, it is supposed that oxygen supply to the brain tissue decreases rather than oxygen consumption in the brain increases. The results of this study indicate that possibly increased CBF could not compensate for reduced arterial oxygen saturation and cerebral tissue hypoxia may occur during the episode of OSA.},

Using four decades of data, we examine how variation in the environment and population density affect reproductive outcomes in a capital-breeding carnivore, the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris). This species provides a unique opportunity to examine the relative importance of resource acquisition and density-dependence on breeding success. Capital breeders accrue resources over large temporal and spatial scales for use during an abbreviated reproductive period. This strategy may have evolved, in part, to confer resilience to short-term environmental variability. We observed density-dependent effects on weaning mass, and maternal age (experience) was more important than oceanographic conditions or maternal mass in determining offspring weaning mass. Together these findings show that the mechanisms controlling reproductive output are conserved across terrestrial and marine systems and vary with population dynamics, an important consideration when assessing the effect of extrinsic changes, such as climate change, on a population.},

  abstract = {Evaluating consequences of stressors on vital rates in marine mammals is of considerable interest to scientific and regulatory bodies. Many of these species face numerous anthropogenic and environmental disturbances. Despite its importance as a critical form of mortality, little is known about disease progression in air-breathing marine megafauna at sea. We examined the movement, diving, foraging behaviour and physiological state of an adult female northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) who suffered from an infection while at sea. Comparing her to healthy individuals, we identified abnormal behavioural patterns from high-resolution biologging instruments that are likely indicators of diseased and deteriorating condition. We observed continuous extended (3--30~minutes) surface intervals coinciding with almost no foraging attempts (jaw motion) during 2~weeks of acute illness early in her post-breeding foraging trip. Elephant seals typically spend {\textasciitilde}\,2~minutes at the surface. There were less frequent but highly extended (30--200~minutes) surface periods across the remainder of the trip. Dive duration declined throughout the trip rather than increasing. This seal returned in the poorest body condition recorded for an adult female elephant seal (18.3\% adipose tissue; post-breeding trip average is 30.4\%). She was immunocompromised at the end of her foraging trip and has not been seen since that moulting season. The timing and severity of the illness, which began during the end of the energy-intensive lactation fast, forced this animal over a tipping point from which she could not recover. Additional physiological constraints to foraging, including thermoregulation and oxygen consumption, likely exacerbated her already poor condition. These findings improve our understanding of illness in free-ranging air-breathing marine megafauna, demonstrate the vulnerability of individuals at critical points in their life history, highlight the importance of considering individual health when interpreting biologging data and could help differentiate between malnutrition and other causes of at-sea mortality from transmitted data.},

Measurements were started in the awake state, the values of which were taken as the control. Contrary to what many have predicted, the cerebral oxygen metabolic rate (CMRO2) increased during the transition from wakefulness to sleep. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) decreased during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep, in which a dissociation between changes in CBF and those in CMRO2 was observed. The CBF returned to the control level even in response to the only 20-s appearance of {$\alpha$} activity on the electroencephalogram. During REM sleep both CBF and CMRO2 were practically the same as the control level, whereas during the transition from REM sleep to arousal a disproportionate increase in CBF compared with CMRO2 was observed. Thus, it is suggested that the flow-metabolic coupling mechanism is reset to a new level during sleep. {\copyright} 1994.},

Clicks and tone pips were presented to individual seals to characterize evoked responses to broad- and narrowband stimuli. Tone pip trains and sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) tones were used to determine modulation rate transfer functions (MRTF) of the auditory system and to determine if the magnitude of the envelope-following response (EFR) relative to the stimulus level can be used to estimate hearing thresholds. Click evoked responses were characterized by three early positive peaks ({\textasciitilde}2.6, 4.4, and 6.1 ms) and a dominant negative peak at 7.2 ms and had average amplitudes of 264 nV (peak-to-peak [pk-pk]) for a corresponding stimulus level of 126 dB re 20 {\textmu}Pa (pk-pk). The use of dissociative drugs for the immobilization of the seals showed no demonstrable effect on the latencies or amplitudes of the click evoked response. Both the rate following response (RFR) and EFR amplitudes were maximal when the stimulus repetition rate or the amplitude modulation rate, respectively, were {$<$} 100 Hz. EFR amplitudes at the rate of amplitude modulation tracked near linearly with stimulus level. Thresholds for a 4-kHz SAM tone were estimated to be 45 dB re 20 {\textmu}Pa.

Models of optimal diving attempt to explain the behaviour of such animals in terms of selection for successful foraging given the constraints imposed by physiology. Several recent papers have questioned the accuracy of both the assumptions and the predictions of these models. Here, I provide a critical review of these papers, arguing that they misrepresent both the models and the data. As a result, they focus on inappropriate tests. I use the debate to suggest various new models and to explore the general relationship between theory and data in behavioural ecology. In particular, I consider the merits of qualitative and quantitative predictions. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

To reveal genomic changes that occurred during this transition, we screened for protein-coding genes that were inactivated in the ancestral cetacean lineage. We found 85 gene losses. Some of these were likely beneficial for cetaceans, for example, by reducing the risk of thrombus formation during diving ( F12 and KLKB1 ), erroneous DNA damage repair ( POLM ), and oxidative stress--induced lung inflammation ( MAP3K19 ). Additional gene losses may reflect other diving-related adaptations, such as enhanced vasoconstriction during the diving response (mediated by SLC6A18 ) and altered pulmonary surfactant composition ( SEC14L3 ), while loss of SLC4A9 relates to a reduced need for saliva. Last, loss of melatonin synthesis and receptor genes ( AANAT , ASMT , and MTNR1A / B ) may have been a precondition for adopting unihemispheric sleep. Our findings suggest that some genes lost in ancestral cetaceans were likely involved in adapting to a fully aquatic lifestyle.},

Each site had three treatment units: an unburned control, a unit burned 2{\texttimes} (1996 and 1999), and a unit burned 4{\texttimes} (1996--1999). Vegetation plots were stratified by an integrated moisture index (IMI) into xeric, intermediate, and mesic classes. Prior to treatments, oak (Quercus spp.) and hickory (Carya spp.) comprised 74--83\% of basal area among sites but shade-tolerant species (e.g., Acer rubrum) were abundant in the midstory and completely dominated the sapling layer. Fires were conducted in March and April. Fire intensity, estimated by temperature-sensitive paints, was highest on the 2{\texttimes} burn units. Fires had little effect on large tree ({$>$}25cm DBH) density and stand basal area. By contrast, the density of small trees (10--25cm DBH) was reduced by 31\% on 2{\texttimes} burn units and by 19\% on 4{\texttimes} burn units. ``Fire-induced'' mortality (i.e., mortality on burn units above that of unburned units) for the most common species of small trees was: A. rubrum=33\%; Quercus alba=17\%; Carya spp.=13\%; Nyssa sylvatica=10\%; Acer saccharum=4\%; Quercus prinus=2\%. Sapling density was reduced by 86\% on burn treatments. Despite reduced small tree and sapling densities on burned units, canopy openness, estimated by hemispherical photography, remained low ({$<$}6\%). In general, the composition of tree regeneration was not substantially altered by fire treatments. On burn units, a significant initial decrease in A. rubrum seedling density and a significant increase in Liriodendron tulipifera from the seed bank did not persist throughout the study. Oak+hickory seedling density was not significantly affected by fire nor was the density of shade-tolerant seedlings. Post-treatment (2002) sampling of large seedlings ({$>$}30cm height) indicated no significant differences in the abundance of oak+hickory nor that of shade-tolerant seedlings among fire treatments. For most vegetation response variables, fire effects tended to be similar among IMI classes. The application of fire alone, without partial harvesting, failed to improve oak regeneration consistently. However, given that two fires reduced stand density, the longer term application of periodic fire, coupled with natural gap dynamics, may still be a feasible management strategy for improving the sustainability of oak forests where harvesting is not permitted or desired.},

After a night of sleep deprivation between 10 P.M. and 3 A.M., a reduction of natural immune responses as measured by NK cell activity, NK activity per number of NK cells, LAK activity, and LAK activity per number of LAK precursors (CD16,56, CD25) was found. In addition, concanavalin A-stimulated IL-2 production was suppressed after sleep deprivation due to changes in both adherent and nonadherent cell populations. After a night of recovery sleep, NK activity returned to baseline levels and IL-2 production remained suppressed. These data implicate sleep in the modulation of immunity and demonstrate that even a modest disturbance of sleep produces a reduction of natural immune responses and T cell cytokine production.},

The sleep architecture of rodents differs from that of diurnal mammals including humans and non-human primates. Sleep studies have been conducted in nonhuman primates; however, these sleep assessments were performed on animals placed in a restraint chair connected via the umbilical area to the recording apparatus. To avoid restraints, cables, and other stressful apparatuses and manipulations, telemetry systems have been developed. In the present study, sleep recordings in unrestrained cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) and common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) were conducted to characterize normal sleep. For the analysis of sleep--wake rhythms in cynomolgus monkeys, telemetry electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and electrooculography (EOG) signals were used. For the analysis of sleep--wake rhythms in marmosets, telemetry EEG and EOG signals were used. Both monkey species showed monophasic sleep patterns during the dark phase. Although non-rapid eye movement (NREM) deep sleep showed higher levels at the beginning of the dark phase in cynomolgus monkeys, NREM deep sleep rarely occurred during the dark phase in marmosets. Our results indicate that the use of telemetry in non-human primate models is useful for sleep studies, and that the different NREM deep sleep activities between cynomolgus monkeys and common marmoset monkeys are useful to examine sleep functions.},

The electrode and its application to the scalp has changed very little since EEG was first discovered and developed as a clinical tool. However, the evolution of amplifiers and data acquisition systems have made tremendous strides. Modern-day EEG recording systems now have the capability to record for days and weeks with little intervention, whereas the EEG electrode requires constant attention and skilled adjustment every 10 to 24 hours. If one surveys the vast array of electrodes used now and in the past, the only electrode that, once placed, never needed any further adjustment for days and weeks on end, was the chronic silver-silver/ chloride (Ag-Ag/Cl) sphenoidal (Sp) electrode. This Sp electrode has now been modified to permit it to be placed subdermally, similar to that of a subdermal needle electrode, but now the needle is removed to leave in place a fine, flexible, durable, chronic Ag-Ag/Cl electrode. Once placed, this subdermal wire electrode (SWE, patent pending) starts to record immediately with a low impedance of 3 to 4 K{\textohm}. This electrode can record any biopotential, in humans and in animals, and in most recording environments; it never needs adjustment, and records high-quality biopotential signals for as long as it is left in place. The SWE is also MRI and computed-tomography compatible. It takes less than half the time to place the SWE, and placement can now be performed by any medically trained personnel to obtain a low-maintenance, high-quality EEG recording.

As a result, determining the effects of anthropogenic noise on marine mammals is currently an active area of research. The development of methods to detect and localize the animals in their native environments is key to advancing this research and our understanding. This paper presents a collection of algorithms for automated passive acoustic detection, classification, and localization of vocalizing marine mammals in open ocean environments. The tool set known as M3R (Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges) uses the large fields of wide-bandwidth bottom-mounted hydrophones that are part of the U.S. Navy's undersea ranges to listen for vocalizing whales. M3R employs time-frequency analysis to passively detect whale vocalizations; it then aligns detections among neighboring hydrophones to determine the difference in times of arrival (TDOA) of each vocalization. Sets of TDOA are then used to determine 2-D or 3-D position points using hyperbolic localization techniques. An M3R system is capable of continuous, automated, real-time monitoring of over 200 wide-bandwidth hydrophones covering 2,000+ km2 of open ocean. M3R is typically used in a collaborative fashion to localize animals in support of tagging exercises, visual surveys, and behavioral response experiments.},

  abstract = {Several current brain imaging techniques rest on the assumption of a tight coupling between neural activity and hemodynamic response. The nature of this neurovascular coupling, however, is not completely understood. There is some evidence for a decoupling of these processes at the onset of neural activity, which manifests itself as a momentary increase in the relative concentration of deoxyhemoglobin (HbR). The existence of this early component of the hemodynamic response function, however, is controversial, as it is inconsistently found. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) allows quantification of levels of oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and HbR during task performance in humans. We acquired NIRS data during performance of simple motor and visual tasks, using rapid-presentation event-related paradigms. Our results demonstrate that rapid, event-related NIRS can provide robust estimates of the hemodynamic response without artifacts due to low-frequency signal components, unlike data from blocked designs. In both the motor and visual data the onset of the increase in HbO2 occurs before HbR decreases, and there is a poststimulus undershoot. Our results also show that total blood volume (HbT) drops before HbO2 and undershoots baseline, raising a new issue for neurovascular models. We did not find early deoxygenation in the motor data using physiologically plausible values for the differential pathlength factor, but did find one in the visual data. We suggest that this difference, which is consistent with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, may be attributable to different capillary transit times in these cortices. {\copyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Millions of people around the world have encountered scientific visualizations through documentary films on giant and small screens. Borkiewicz et al.

Specifically, cinematic scientific visualization should be (a) based on real data, (b) understandable and (c) entertaining for a general public audience. To investigate what is known about how audiences respond to this type of science communication, this essay presents an overview of the literature on this topic, highlighting key findings, gaps and directions for future research. The sprawling nature of the theoretical and empirical research literature on audience responses to cinematic scientific visualization makes it difficult to achieve comprehensive coverage of relevant studies and theoretical models. Recurring methodological limitations present further challenges to establishing a foundation of reliable knowledge on this topic. Nevertheless, prior research has identified several factors that affect how public audiences respond to cinematic scientific visualizations. Here, we discuss findings relating to intelligibility, film content and immersion. These results offer a basis for hypotheses to be tested by future confirmatory studies of audience responses to cinematic scientific visualizations.},

Some reef fishes, such as groupers and moray eels, are more toxic than others. We hypothesized that fish containing CTXs could produce special proteins or detoxification proteins as a strategy for survival during the accumulation of CTXs. The objective of this study was to characterize the differential proteomes of the toxic and nontoxic hepatic tissue of grouper, Cephalopholis argus and moray eel, Gymnothorax undulatus, which had elevated levels of CTXs. A combination of two dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrum approaches was employed for preliminary screening of the liver proteome of wild-caught individuals. In C. argus with elevated CTXs, the expression level of cytoskeleton proteins was increased, whereas those of ubiquitin enzymes, ATP related enzymes, and telomerase reverse transcriptase were greatly reduced. In CTX-containing G. undulatus, the proteins involved in Ca2+ binding, detoxification, antiapoptosis, immune defense, enhanced cell survival and proliferation were elevated. In both toxic fish species, the ATP synthase subunit beta and cytochrome c were down-regulated. However further study is needed to assess their potential roles in the resistance mechanism to contamination by CTXs. In conclusion, the comparative proteomic analysis revealed that CTXs induced influx/efflux of Na+ or Ca2+ changes in fish liver, with a concomitant interference with signal transduction, metabolomics processes, detoxification, antiapoptosis, immune defense, enhanced cell survival and proliferation etc.},

  abstract = {As human--wildlife conflicts escalate worldwide, concepts such as tolerance and acceptance of wildlife are becoming increasingly important. Yet, contemporary conservation studies indicate a limited understanding of positive human--wildlife interactions, leading to potentially inaccurate representations of human--animal encounters. Failure to address these limitations contributes to the design and implementation of poor wildlife and landscape management plans and the dismissal of Indigenous ecological knowledge. We examined Indigenous perspectives on human--wildlife coexistence in India by drawing ethnographic evidence from Kattunayakans, a forest-dwelling Adivasi community living in the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary in Kerala. Through qualitative field study that involved interviews and transect walks inside the forests, we found that Kattunayakans displayed tolerance and acceptance of wild animals characterized as forms of deep coexistence that involves three central ideas: wild animals as rational conversing beings; wild animals as gods, teachers, and equals; and wild animals as relatives with shared origins practicing dharmam. We argue that understanding these adequately will support efforts to bring Kattunayakan perspectives into the management of India's forests and contribute to the resolution of the human--wildlife conflict more broadly.},

  abstract = {Like many species, movement patterns of southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) are being influenced by long-term environmental change. These seals migrate up to 4,000 km from their breeding colonies, foraging for months in a variety of Southern Ocean habitats. Understanding how movement patterns vary with environmental features and how these relationships differ among individuals employing different foraging strategies can provide insight into foraging performance at a population level. We apply new fast-estimation tools to fit mixed effects within a random walk movement model, rapidly inferring among-individual variability in southern elephant seal environment--movement relationships. We found that seals making foraging trips to the sea ice on or near the Antarctic continental shelf consistently reduced speed and directionality (move persistence) with increasing sea-ice coverage but had variable responses to chlorophyll a concentration, whereas seals foraging in the open ocean reduced move persistence in regions where circumpolar deep water shoaled. Given future climate scenarios, open-ocean foragers may encounter more productive habitat but sea-ice foragers may see reduced habitat availability. Our approach is scalable to large telemetry data sets and allows flexible combinations of mixed effects to be evaluated via model selection, thereby illuminating the ecological context of animal movements that underlie habitat usage.},

Killer whales and white sharks are prominent upper trophic level predators with highly-overlapping niches, yet their ecological interactions and subsequent effects have remained obscure. Using long-term electronic tagging and survey data we reveal rare and cryptic interactions between these predators at a shared foraging site, Southeast Farallon Island (SEFI). In multiple instances, brief visits from killer whales displaced white sharks from SEFI, disrupting shark feeding behavior for extended periods at this aggregation site. As a result, annual predations of pinnipeds by white sharks at SEFI were negatively correlated with close encounters with killer whales. Tagged white sharks relocated to other aggregation sites, creating detectable increases in white shark density at Ano Nuevo Island. This work highlights the importance of risk effects and intraguild relationships among top ocean predators and the value of long-term data sets revealing these consequential, albeit infrequent, ecological interactions.},

Next, the implementation of a miniature microsystem for low-latency automatic sleep stage classification in rodents is presented. The classification algorithm uses one EMG (electromyogram) and two EEG (electroencephalogram) signals as inputs in order to detect REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, and is optimized for low complexity and low power consumption. It is implemented in an on-board low-power FPGA connected to a multi-channel neural recording IC, to achieve low-latency (order of 1 ms or less) classification. Off-line experimental results using pre-recorded signals from nine mice show REM detection sensitivity and specificity of 81.69\% and 93.86\%, respectively, with the maximum latency of 39 {$\mu$}s. The device is designed to be used in a non-disruptive closed-loop REM sleep suppression microsystem, for future studies of the effects of REM sleep deprivation on memory consolidation.},

As baselines are sought by the research community, the volume and rate of this required data collection rapidly outpaces our abilities to process and analyze them. Recent advances in machine learning enables fast, sophisticated analysis of visual data, but have had limited success in the ocean due to lack of data standardization, insufficient formatting, and demand for large, labeled datasets. To address this need, we built FathomNet, an open-source image database that standardizes and aggregates expertly curated labeled data. FathomNet has been seeded with existing iconic and non-iconic imagery of marine animals, underwater equipment, debris, and other concepts, and allows for future contributions from distributed data sources. We demonstrate how FathomNet data can be used to train and deploy models on other institutional video to reduce annotation effort, and enable automated tracking of underwater concepts when integrated with robotic vehicles. As FathomNet continues to grow and incorporate more labeled data from the community, we can accelerate the processing of visual data to achieve a healthy and sustainable global ocean.},

However, little is known of the ecological impacts of large fires on both historical and contemporary landscapes. The present paper presents a review of the current knowledge of the effects of large fires in the United States by important ecosystems written by regional experts. The ecosystems are (1) ponderosa pine--Douglas-fir, (2) sagebrush--grasslands, (3) pi{\~n}on--juniper, (4) chaparral, (5) mixed-conifer, and (6) spruce--fir. This review found that large fires were common on most historical western US landscapes and they will continue to be common today with exceptions. Sagebrush ecosystems are currently experiencing larger, more severe, and more frequent large fires compared to historical conditions due to exotic cheatgrass invasions. Historical large fires in south-west ponderosa pine forest created a mixed severity mosaic dominated by non-lethal surface fires while today's large fires are mostly high severity crown fires. While large fires play an important role in landscape ecology for most regions, their importance is much less in the dry pi{\~n}on--juniper forests and sagebrush--grasslands. Fire management must address the role of large fires in maintaining the health of many US fire-dominated ecosystems.},

In many disciplines, data and model scenarios are becoming multifaceted: data are often spatiotemporal and multivariate; they stem from different data sources (multimodal data), from multiple simulation runs (multirun/ensemble data), or from multiphysics simulations of interacting phenomena (multimodel data resulting from coupled simulation models). Also, data can be of different dimensionality or structured on various types of grids that need to be related or fused in the visualization. This heterogeneity of data characteristics presents new opportunities as well as technical challenges for visualization research. Visualization and interaction techniques are thus often combined with computational analysis. In this survey, we study existing methods for visualization and interactive visual analysis of multifaceted scientific data. Based on a thorough literature review, a categorization of approaches is proposed. We cover a wide range of fields and discuss to which degree the different challenges are matched with existing solutions for visualization and visual analysis. This leads to conclusions with respect to promising research directions, for instance, to pursue new solutions for multirun and multimodel data as well as techniques that support a multitude of facets.},

  abstract = {Predators can have profound effects on their environments. By identifying patterns in behavior, den fidelity, and distribution, this study sought to bring to light the importance of moray eels, a group of cryptic, hole-dwelling apex predators. In this study, conducted on Moorea in French Polynesia, six Indo-Pacific moray species were found (Gymnothorax javanicus, Gymnothorax flavimarginatus, Gymnothorax pictus, Gymnothorax meleagris, Gymnomuraena zebra, and Echidna nebulosa). Within G. javanicus, G. flavimarginatus, and E. nebulosa (for which we had the highest sample sizes), behavior was analyzed using a detailed ethogram. Den fidelity over 20 days was analyzed with relation to species, life stage, and weather. Distribution was examined with relation to species and environmental characteristics. For comparisons across species, the behavioral study suggested a possible ecological trade-off between adult size and camouflage. Small adult sizes generally resulted in increased defensive behavior, but their lighter camouflage allowed them to be more active and remain exposed. Large adult sizes tended to have darker camouflage and while they did not exhibit the same amount of defensive behavior, they were less active and less likely to remain exposed. Juveniles in all three species had aggressive mouth behavior, but were inactive relative to adults. They had much higher den fidelity than adults. Den fidelity was higher in less active species (G. javanicus and G. flavimarginatus) than in more active E. nebulosa and G. pictus. Also, den fidelity was higher during periods of inclement weather. The distribution study showed a strong shift in species occupation with percent live coral along the transect studied, where G. javanicus dominated shallower, lower percent live coral areas with steady food inputs from fishermen. This study showed the importance of adult size, camouflage, and age in determining activity and defensive behavior while investigating possible trends for distribution near the mouths of bays with significant human impact.},

  abstract = {Wild animals have evolved extreme physiological adaptations to balance the risks of starvation, predation, and exhaustion. Sleeping animals sacrifice food while vulnerable to predators. Marine mammals at sea balance the need to feed with the added challenge of surfacing to breathe, where predators lie in wait. Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) travel thousands of kilometers, performing long dives to gather sustenance before returning to land to fast while they breed or molt. For my dissertation, I engineered a device that measures when, how, and how much these animals sleep at sea- the first recording of sleep in a wild marine mammal. Across their amphibious habitat, seals slept as much as 14 hours per day on land in the lab and as little as 0 hours per day at sea. Analytical methods derived from these results allow us to interpret hundreds of diving records over a 20-year dataset to find that seals sleep about 2 hours per day during {$>$}220-day foraging trips. At sea, elephant seals leverage their extreme breath-holding capacity to create a safe sleeping niche, up to 377 meters below the surface. I developed a process to transform data into animated 3D visualizations that display physiology alongside behavior. As new technology facilitates the collection of large ecophysiology datasets, we must also advance sensor technology, analytical workflows, and visualization techniques to better interpret this data. My dissertation creates and implements novel instruments and techniques that record, characterize, and visualize the physiology and behavior of wild animals to facilitate comparative neurophysiology research within conservation and translational medicine.},

Phoca uitulina were subjected to simulated maximum dives by submerging their heads until the appearance of reversible characteristic hypoxic patterns in their electroencephalogram (EEG endpoint). The mean endpoint PO,, defined as the oxygen tension in the blood at the EEG endpoint, was 10 mm Hg in arterial and 2.5 mm Hg in cerebral venous blood. These values, lower than those reported for terrestrial laborabory mammals, held over a wide range of blood pH and Pco2 values. During the last five minutes of the dive (averaging 18 min in duration) cerebral (a-v)C,, diminished and cerebral (v-a) lactate content increased. Independent measurements of blood flow in the intravertebral vein showed that cerebral blood flow during diving was about two-thirds of the pre-dive value and that it remained substantially unchanged throughout the dive. It is concluded that during prolonged apneic asphyxia the seal's brain, unlike that of terrestrial mammals, tolerates a definite period of go1 reduction prior to the onset of gross functional impairment.},

  abstract = {Sex-specific phenotypic differences are widespread throughout the animal kingdom. Reproductive advantages provided by trait differences come at a cost. Here, we link sex-specific foraging strategies to trade-offs between foraging reward and mortality risk in sexually dimorphic northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris). We analyse a decadal dataset on movement patterns, dive behaviour, foraging success and mortality rates. Females are deep-diving predators in open ocean habitats. Males are shallow-diving benthic predators in continental shelf habitats. Males gain six times more mass and acquire energy 4.1 times faster than females. High foraging success comes with a high mortality rate. Males are six times more likely to die than females. These foraging strategies and trade-offs are related to different energy demands and life-history strategies. Males use a foraging strategy with a high mortality risk to attain large body sizes necessary to compete for females, as only a fraction of the largest males ever mate. Females use a foraging strategy with a lower mortality risk, maximizing reproductive success by pupping annually over a long lifespan. Our results highlight how sex-specific traits can drive disparity in mortality rates and expand species' niche space. Further, trade-offs between foraging rewards and mortality risk can differentially affect each sex's ability to maximize fitness.},

  abstract = {Only a few reports have described how pinnipeds hunt schooling fish. However, we had the opportunity to systematically observe captive harbor seals hunting a school of herring in a shallow enclosure during daylight. The seals actively pursued the fish, mostly changing from one side of the school to the other, swimming in a supine position close to the water surface. They were often found swimming rapidly down to the fish out of this position. When hunting in the vertical, the seals mostly adopted a dorsal body posture relative to the school. They swam and attacked the school in a supine orientation when approaching from the water surface and swam in a prone orientation when approaching from below. They even maintained this relative body position during turning movements. These phenomena suggest that the seals were constantly keeping the school in their large dorsal visual field, which favors visual hunting during daylight and in clear waters. When interacting with the school, the school mostly split asymmetrically, and the seals were following preferably a smaller number of fish afterwards. Successful prey catch was only observed, when a small group or a single herring had been separated, thus the seals probably avoided the confusion effect of the school. In conclusion, we provide detailed insight in seals pursuing schooling prey, thereby extending previous reports and confirming speculations as well as brief observations.},

The research on laboratory animals provide insights to various practical applications involving human beings and other animals such as working animals, pets, and livestock. An experimental framework targeting the laboratory animals has the potential to lead to successful translational research when it closely resembles the environment of real applications. To serve scalp electroencephalography (EEG) research environments for the laboratory mice, the dry non-invasive scalp EEG sensor with sixteen electrodes is proposed to measure brainwaves over the entire brain area without any surgical procedures. We validated the proposed sensor system with visual evoked potential (VEP) experiments elicited by flash stimulations. The VEP responses obtained from experiments are compared with the existing literature, and analyzed in temporal and spatial perspectives. We further interpret the experimental results using time-frequency distribution (TFD) and distance measurements. The developed sensor guarantees stable operations for in vivo experiments in a non-invasive manner without surgical procedures, therefore exhibiting a high potential to strengthen longitudinal experimental studies and reliable translational research exploiting non-invasive paradigms.},

  abstract = {Dog aggression to humans is a serious problem and it appears that fear-induced aggression in dogs is often implicated. Furthermore, it has been suggested that novel and startling stimuli may trigger fear-induced aggression. The aim of the present study was to study some possible behavioural and physiological measures of fear in the dog Canis familiaris in tests involving novel and startling stimuli. Dogs (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 108) of various breeds, sex and experience were observed in four tests previously reported to induce fear-related responses in various animal species. A range of behavioural and physiological variables was recorded, such as latencies to approach the stimulus, time spent near stimulus and heart rate changes. Data were examined using correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Moderate to high correlations were found between some of the variables within and between the tests and a number of variables were identified in three components determined by the PCA. These three components accounted for 48\% of the total variation and components 1 and 3 contained high loadings for the latency to approach and time spent near the stimulus in a novel object test and a startling test, respectively. Component 2 contained variables measuring latencies and entries to areas in a light/dark test and an elevated plus maze test. It is suggested that component 1 may be a measure of a response to novelty and component 3 may be a measure of a response to startling stimuli, while component 2 may be a measure of exploration. Components 1 and 3 may thus be appropriate measures of different aspects of fear. The suitability of each test and its limitations in measuring fear of novel and startling stimuli in the dog are discussed.},

Experimental evidence suggests that oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are important mechanisms underlying the seizurogenic potential of environmental toxicants but these pathways are relatively unstudied in CSLs. In the current study, we investigated the role of glutamate-glutamine changes and gliosis in DA-exposed CSLs to better understand the neurotoxic mechanisms occurring during DA toxicity. Sections from archived hippocampi from control and CSLs diagnosed with DA toxicosis were immunofluorescently stained for markers of gliosis, oxidative/nitrative stress and changes in glutamine synthetase (GS). Quantitative assessment revealed increasing loss of microtubule associated protein-2 positive neurons with elevations in 4-hydroxynonenal correlating with chronicity of exposure, whereas the pattern of activated glia expressing nitric oxide synthase 2 and tumor necrosis factor followed pathological severity. There was no significant change in the amount of GS positive cells but there was increased 3-nitrotyrosine in GS expressing cells and in neurons, particularly in animals with chronic DA toxicosis. These changes were consistently seen in the dentate gyrus and in the cornu ammonis (CA) sectors CA3, CA4, and CA1. The results of this study indicate that gliosis and resultant changes in GS are likely important mechanisms in DA-induced seizure that need to be further explored as potential therapies in treating exposed wildlife.},

Marine mammals have developed methods to retain heat in cold seas using a suite of physiological, biochemical, anatomical, and behavioral methods. Yet, they must be able to lose excess heat when they are on land or extremely active in the water. If the problem was one of solely evolving methods to stay warm in a cold ocean, it would be easier to wrap themselves in deep blubber and fur or to stay very active and not to have deal with the consequences of heat loading. However, the difficulty of that solution is that the animal would get too warm, which in turn would cause problems with metabolic regulation, reproductive chemistry and neural function. Thus, the thermoregulatory mechanisms that have evolved in marine mammals function not only to conserve heat but also to dump it when necessary.},

  abstract = {Risk assessment of the amnesic shellfish poison, domoic acid, a potent neurotoxin, is evaluated based on its current knowledge and its harmful effects, and is presented under four headings, viz., (1) hazard identification, (2) dose response assessment, (3) exposure assessment and (4) risk characterization. Domoic acid binds the glutamate receptor site of the central nervous system (CNS) of humans and causes depolarization of neurons and an increase in cellular calcium. In nature, domoic acid is produced by the algae, Pseudonitzschia spp. and they enter into the body of shellfish through their consumption. This toxin is reported to cause gastroenteritis, renal insufficiency, confusion and memory loss in humans, since it affects the hippocampus of the brain. In rats, intraperitonial and oral administration of domoic acid result in scratching, tremor and convulsions, and in monkeys, the toxic symptoms like mastication, salivation, projectile vomiting, weakness, teeth grinding and lethargy are apparent. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) in animals reveals that pure toxin is more effective than those isolated from shellfish. Based on LD50 values, it is found that intraperitonial administration of this toxin in animals is 31 fold more effective than oral administration. Low levels of domoic acid (0.20 -- 0.75 ppm) show no toxic symptoms in non-human primates, but clinical effects are apparent in them and in humans, at a concentration of 1.0 ppm. The tolerable daily intake (TDI) of domoic acid for humans is calculated as 0.075 ppm, whereas for razor clams and crabs, the TDI are 19.4 and 31.5 ppm respectively. The hazard quotient (HQ) is found to be 2. Being an irreversible neurotoxin, domoic acid has severe public health implications. Death occurs in those above 68 years old. In order to ensure adequate protection to public health, the concentration of domoic acid in shellfish and shellfish parts at point of sale shall not exceed the current permissible limit of 20 {\textmu}g g-1 tissue.

At any given time, body temperature differs from the expected value by no more than a few tenths of a degree. However, slight daily variations are due to circadian rhythm, and, in women, monthly variations are due to their menstrual cycle. Importantly, both anesthesia and surgery dramatically alter this delicate control, and as a result intraoperative core temperatures 1 to 3 {$^\circ$}C below normal are not uncommon. Consequently, perioperative hypothermia leads to a number of complications including postoperative shivering (which unacceptably increases patients' metabolic rates), impaired coagulation, prolonged drug action, and negative postoperative nitrogen balance. In this review I will describe how anesthesia and surgery impair thermoregulation, the resulting changes in heat balance, and the physiological responses provoked by perioperative alterations in body temperature. {\copyright} 2008.},

  abstract = {Can machine learning help us make better decisions about a changing planet? In this paper, we illustrate and discuss the potential of a promising corner of machine learning known as deep reinforcement learning (RL) to help tackle the most challenging conservation decision problems. We provide a conceptual and technical introduction to deep RL as well as annotated code so that researchers can adopt, evaluate and extend these approaches. RL explicitly focuses on designing an agent who interacts with an environment that is dynamic and uncertain. Deep RL is the subfield of RL that incorporates deep neural networks into the agent. We train deep RL agents to solve sequential decision-making problems in setting fisheries quotas and managing ecological tipping points. We show that a deep RL agent is able to learn a nearly optimal solution for the fisheries management problem. For the tipping point problem, we show that a deep RL agent can outperform a sensible rule-of-thumb strategy. Our results demonstrate that deep RL has the potential to solve challenging decision problems in conservation. While this potential may be compelling, the challenges involved in successfully deploying RL-based management to realistic scenarios are formidable---the required expertise and computational cost may place these applications beyond the reach of all but large, international technology firms. Ecologists must establish a better understanding of how these algorithms work and fail if we are to realize this potential and avoid the pitfalls such a transition would bring. We ultimately set forth a research framework based on well-posed, public challenges so that ecologists and computer scientists can collaborate towards solving hard decision-making problems in conservation.},

In water, however, fur seals exhibit asymmetric slow-wave sleep (ASWS), resembling the unihemispheric slow-wave sleep of odontocetes (toothed whales). The unique sleeping pattern of fur seals allows us to distinguish neuronal mechanisms mediating EEG changes from those mediating behavioral quiescence. In a prior study we found that cortical acetylcholine release is lateralized during ASWS in the northern fur seal, with greater release in the hemisphere displaying low-voltage (waking) EEG activity, linking acetylcholine release to hemispheric EEG activation (Lapierre et al. 2007). In contrast to acetylcholine, we now report that cortical serotonin release is not lateralized during ASWS. Our data demonstrate that bilaterally symmetric levels of serotonin are compatible with interhemispheric EEG asymmetry in the fur seal. We also find greatly elevated levels during eating and hosing the animals with water, suggesting that serotonin is more closely linked to bilateral variables, such as axial motor and autonomic control, than to the lateralized cortical activation manifested in asymmetrical sleep. {\copyright} 2013 the authors.},

  abstract = {Sexual segregation in foraging is predicted from the great size disparity of male and female northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris. Our aim was to test this prediction by measuring diving and foraging behavior, foraging locations, and distribution of the sexes during biannual migrations in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Daily movements of 27 adult males and 20 adult females, during 56 migrations from A{\~n}o Nuevo, California, USA, were determined by Argos satellite telemetry via head-mounted platform transmitter terminals. Diving records were obtained with archival time--depth--speed recorders attached to the backs of seals that were recovered when the seals returned to the rookery. Pronounced sex differences were found in foraging location and foraging pattern, as reflected by horizontal transit speed and diving behavior. Males moved directly north or northwest at a mean speed of 90 {\textpm} 27 km/d to focal foraging areas along the continental margin ranging from coastal Oregon (534 km away) to the western Aleutian Islands (4775 km away). Males remained in these areas (mean size = 7892 km2) for 21--84\% of their 4-mo stays at sea. The predominance of flat-bottom dives in these areas suggests concentrated feeding on benthic prey. Migration distance and estimated mass gain were positively correlated with male size, and individual males returned to the same area to forage on subsequent migrations. In contrast, females ranged across a wider area of the northeastern Pacific, from 38{$^\circ$} to 60{$^\circ$} N and from the coast to 172.5{$^\circ$} E. Focal foraging areas, indicated by a reduction in swim speed to {$<$}0.4 m/s, were distributed over deep water along the migratory path, with females remaining on them a mean of 3.5 d before moving to another one. Jagged-bottom dives that tracked the deep scattering layer prevailed in these areas, suggesting that females were feeding on pelagic prey in the water column. Females took roughly similar initial paths in subsequent migrations, but large deviations from the previous route were observed. We conclude that there is habitat segregation between the sexes. Females range widely over deep water, apparently foraging on patchily distributed, vertically migrating, pelagic prey, whereas males forage along the continental margin at the distal end of their migration in a manner consistent with feeding on benthic prey.},

Great variation in lifetime reproductive success was evident in three aspects of life history: (1) 75\% of the females died before reaching breeding age and produced no pups; (2) nearly half of the survivors bred for only a few years before dying, and young females had low weaning success; (3) less than 1\% of the females in the sample were exceptionally successful producing up to 20 pups in life. Many females that bred early, while still growing, had decreased lifespan, low weaning success, and lower lifetime reproductive success than females that postponed first breeding. Exceptional reproductive success was associated with giving birth annually, living long (up to age 23), and weaning large pups that were more likely to survive and breed. We conclude that there is strong selection for increased lifespan and multiparous supermoms that contribute significantly to pup production in the next generation.},

These are then mathematically formalised to produce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines. We believe that this equation formally captures the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense. We then show how this formal definition is related to the theory of universal optimal learning agents. Finally, we survey the many other tests and definitions of intelligence that have been proposed for machines.},

Here, it is assumed that interspecific variation in the time spent asleep reflects underlying differences in the need for sleep. If true, then significant predictors of sleep times should provide insight into the function of sleep. Many such analyses have sought the evolutionary determinants of mammalian sleep by relating the time spent in the two basic states of sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep, to constitutive variables thought to be functionally related to sleep. However, the early analyses had several methodological problems, and recent re-analyses have overturned some widely accepted relationships, such as the idea that species with higher metabolic rates engage in more sleep. These more recent studies also provide evolutionarily broad support for a neurophysiological role for REM sleep. Furthermore, results from comparative analyses suggest that animals are particularly vulnerable to predation during REM sleep, a finding that lends further support to the notion that REM sleep must serve an important function. Here, we review the methodology and results of quantitative comparative studies of sleep. We highlight important developments in our understanding of the evolutionary determinants of sleep and emphasize relationships that address prevailing hypotheses for the functions of sleep.

We highlight important developments in our understanding of the evolutionary determinants of sleep and emphasize relationships that address prevailing hypotheses for the functions of sleep. Lastly, we outline a possible future for comparative analyses, focusing on work in non-mammalian groups, the use of more physiologically meaningful variables, and electrophysiological sleep studies conducted in the wild. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Mammals and birds engage in two distinct states of sleep, slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. SWS is characterized by slow, high amplitude brain waves, while REM sleep is characterized by fast, low amplitude waves, known as activation, occurring with rapid eye movements and reduced muscle tone. However, monotremes (platypuses and echidnas), the most basal (or `ancient') group of living mammals, show only a single sleep state that combines elements of SWS and REM sleep, suggesting that these states became temporally segregated in the common ancestor to marsupial and eutherian mammals. Whether sleep in basal birds resembles that of monotremes or other mammals and birds is unknown. Here, we provide the first description of brain activity during sleep in ostriches (Struthio camelus), a member of the most basal group of living birds. We found that the brain activity of sleeping ostriches is unique. Episodes of REM sleep were delineated by rapid eye movements, reduced muscle tone, and head movements, similar to those observed in other birds and mammals engaged in REM sleep; however, during REM sleep in ostriches, forebrain activity would flip between REM sleep-like activation and SWS-like slow waves, the latter reminiscent of sleep in the platypus. Moreover, the amount of REM sleep in ostriches is greater than in any other bird, just as in platypuses, which have more REM sleep than other mammals. These findings reveal a recurring sequence of steps in the evolution of sleep in which SWS and REM sleep arose from a single heterogeneous state that became temporally segregated into two distinct states. This common trajectory suggests that forebrain activation during REM sleep is an evolutionarily new feature, presumably involved in performing new sleep functions not found in more basal animals.},

Defensive aggression arising from fear may be implicated in some attacks and thus research on measuring fear in dogs is clearly required. The aim of the present study was to examine the validity of several measures of fear of novel and startling stimuli previously identified in the authors' laboratory. Anxiolytic drugs have been shown to reduce fear behaviour in rats in novel situations and thus an anxiolytic drug, clomipramine, was used in the present study to examine the validity of these previously identified measures of fear. Twenty-four dogs of varying breed, age and sex were used in a cross-over design, involving a placebo treatment and a clomipramine treatment. It was found that when the dogs were medicated with clomipramine for 6 weeks they were quicker to approach and spent more time near the stimulus (P {$<$} 0.05) in a novel object test. Furthermore, there was a tendency (P = 0.06) for a treatment by order interaction in which treatment with clomipramine in the first period but not the second period was associated with reduced latency to approach and increased time spent near the stimulus in the startling test. There was no treatment effect on latencies and entries to areas in a light/dark test and an elevated plus maze test. These results indicate that a number of behavioural variables in two of the tests, the novel object and startling test, are measures of fear of novel and startling stimuli, respectively, in dogs and furthermore provide a useful methodology to study fear-induced aggression in dogs. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The main contribution of this paper is to show that openness is differentiated, and to offer scientific documentation of degrees of openness in this fast-moving field. We evaluate projects in terms of openness of code, training data, model weights, RLHF data, licensing, scientific documentation, and access methods. We find that while there is a fast-growing list of projects billing themselves as `open source', many inherit undocumented data of dubious legality, few share the all-important instruction-tuning (a key site where human annotation labour is involved), and careful scientific documentation is exceedingly rare. Degrees of openness are relevant to fairness and accountability at all points, from data collection and curation to model architecture, and from training and fine-tuning to release and deployment.},

In this paper we undertake a novel approach to studying resource growth problems using a computational form of adaptive management to find optimal strategies for prevalent natural resource management dilemmas. We scrutinize adaptive management, or learning-by-doing, to better understand how to simultaneously manage and learn about a system when its dynamics are unknown. We study important trade-offs in decision-making with respect to choosing optimal actions (harvest efforts) for sustainable management during change. This is operationalized through an artificially intelligent model where we analyze how different trends and fluctuations in growth rates of a renewable resource affect the performance of different management strategies. Our results show that the optimal strategy for managing resources with declining growth is capable of managing resources with fluctuating or increasing growth at a negligible cost, creating in a management strategy that is both efficient and robust towards future unknown changes. To obtain this strategy, adaptive management should strive for: high learning rates to new knowledge, high valuation of future outcomes and modest exploration around what is perceived as the optimal action.},

We present a new simulation tool called QUIC-Fire to rapidly solve these feedbacks by coupling the mature 3-D rapid wind solver QUIC-URB to a physics-based cellular automata fire spread model Fire-CA. QUIC-Fire uses 3-D fuels inputs similar to the CFD model FIRETEC, allowing this tool to simulate effects of fuel structure on local winds and fire behavior. Results comparing fire behavior metrics to the computational fluid dynamic model FIRETEC show strong agreement.

  abstract = {Background: Advances in biologging technology allow researchers access to previously unobservable behavioral states and movement patterns of marine animals. To relate behaviors with environmental variables, features must be evaluated at scales relevant to the animal or behavior. Remotely sensed environmental data, collected via satellites, often suffers from the effects of cloud cover and lacks the spatial or temporal resolution to adequately link with individual animal behaviors or behavioral bouts. This study establishes a new method for remotely and continuously quantifying surface ice concentration (SIC) at a scale relevant to individual whales using on-animal tag video data. Results: Motion-sensing and video-recording suction cup tags were deployed on 7 Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) around the Antarctic Peninsula in February and March of 2018. To compare the scale of camera-tag observations with satellite imagery, the area of view was simulated using camera-tag parameters. For expected conditions, we found the visible area maximum to be {\textasciitilde} 100m2 which indicates that observations occur at an equivalent or finer scale than a single pixel of high-resolution visible spectrum satellite imagery. SIC was classified into one of six bins (0\%, 1-20\%, 21-40\%, 41-60\%, 61-80\%, 81-100\%) by two independent observers for the initial and final surfacing between dives. In the event of a disagreement, a third independent observer was introduced, and the median of the three observer's values was used. Initial results (n = 6) show that Antarctic minke whales in the coastal bays of the Antarctic Peninsula spend 52\% of their time in open water, and only 15\% of their time in water with SIC greater than 20\%. Over time, we find significant variation in observed SIC, indicating that Antarctic minke occupy an extremely dynamic environment. Sentinel-2 satellite-based approaches of sea ice assessment were not possible because of persistent cloud cover during the study period. Conclusion: Tag-video offers a means to evaluate ice concentration at spatial and temporal scales relevant to the individual. Combined with information on underwater behavior, our ability to quantify SIC continuously at the scale of the animal will improve upon current remote sensing methods to understand the link between animal behavior and these dynamic environmental variables.},

Emerging as a potent broad-spectrum antioxidant, melatonin was repurposed into extra roles such as the modulation of circadian and seasonal rhythmicity, affecting numerous aspects of physiology and behaviour, including sleep entrainment and locomotor activity. Interestingly, the pineal gland---the melatonin synthesising organ in vertebrates---was suggested to be absent or rudimentary in some mammalian lineages, including Cetacea. In Cetacea, pineal regression is paralleled by their unique bio-rhythmicity, as illustrated by the unihemispheric sleeping behaviour and long-term vigilance. Here, we examined the genes responsible for melatonin synthesis (Aanat and Asmt) and signalling (Mtnr1a and Mtnr1b) in 12 toothed and baleen whale genomes. Based on an ample genomic comparison, we deduce that melatonin-related gene modules are eroded in Cetacea.},

In An Introduction to the Event-Related Potential Technique, Steve Luck offers the first comprehensive guide to the practicalities of conducting ERP experiments in cognitive neuroscience and related fields, including affective neuroscience and experimental psychopathology. The book can serve as a guide for the classroom or the laboratory and as a reference for researchers who do not conduct ERP studies themselves but need to understand and evaluate ERP experiments in the literature. It summarizes the accumulated body of ERP theory and practice, providing detailed, practical advice about how to design, conduct, and interpret ERP experiments and presents the theoretical background needed to understand why an experiment is carried out in a particular way. Luck focuses on the most fundamental techniques, describing them as they are used in many of the world's leading ERP laboratories. These techniques provide an excellent foundation for more advanced approaches and reflect a long history of electrophysiological recordings. The book also provides advice on the key topic of how to design ERP experiments so that they will be useful in answering questions of broad scientific interest. This reflects the increasing proportion of ERP research that focuses on these broader questions rather than the "ERPology" of early studies that concentrated primarily on ERP components and methods. Topics covered include the neural origins of ERPs, signal averaging, artifact rejection and correction, filtering, measurement and analysis, localization, and the practicalities of setting up the lab.},

Our analysis reveals several trends, including a tendency to focus on meteorological datasets over climate impacts, the widespread use of interactive maps for displaying climate data and the growing use of interactive options to promote sharing of results and user configurations. We found that distinguishing CVTs as being either ``exploratory'' or ``explanatory'' in their goal was useful in characterizing their visual and interactive complexity.

The performance of fur seals was evaluated in a two-choice visual delayed matching to sample (DMTS) task, which is commonly used to evaluate working memory. In baseline conditions, the performance of fur seals in a DMTS task based on the percentage of errors was somewhat comparable with that in nonhuman primates at similar delays. We have determined that a 108-h TSD did not affect fur seals' performance in a visual DMTS task as measured by overall percentage of errors and response latencies. On the contrary, all fur seals improved task performance over the study, including the baseline, TSD and recovery conditions. In addition, TSD did not change the direction and strength of the pattern of behavioral lateralization in fur seals. We conclude that a 108-h TSD did not interfere with working memory in a DMTS test in northern fur seals.},

  abstract = {Adult dolphins are capable of sleeping with one eye open and exhibiting slow wave activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of one hemisphere at a time. The aim of this study was to examine the postpartum sleep behavior of bottlenose dolphin calves and their mothers. The behavior of three dolphin mother--calf pairs was monitored from birth to 13 months postpartum. Dolphin mothers and their calves exhibited a complete disappearance of rest at the surface for a minimum of 2 months postpartum, swimming in echelon formation on average in 97--100\% of the observation time. Calves surfaced to breathe more often than their mothers between the postpartum age of 2 and 8 weeks. During the first postpartum month two dolphin mothers surfaced with both eyes open on average in 93 and 98\% of the time while in their calves both eyes were open in 90 and 60\% of the cases. In calves, the eye directed toward the mother was open more often (on average in 95\% of all observations in calf 1 and 99\% in calf 2) than the eye directed to the opposite side (82\% in calf 1 and 60\% in calf 2). Our data indicate that dolphin mothers and calves are highly active and vigilant during the initial period of the calf's life, continuously monitoring their position relative to each other by sight during wakefulness and sleep. We hypothesize that episodes of EEG slow wave activity at this time are likely to be brief, fragmenting EEG defined sleep into short episodes.},

  abstract = {Virtually all land mammals and birds have two sleep states: slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep [1, 2]. After deprivation of REM sleep by repeated awakenings, mammals increase REM sleep time [3], supporting the idea that REM sleep is homeostatically regulated. Some evidence suggests that periods of REM sleep deprivation for a week or more cause physiological dysfunction and eventual death [4, 5]. However, separating the effects of REM sleep loss from the stress of repeated awakening is difficult [2, 6]. The northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) is a semiaquatic mammal [7]. It can sleep on land and in seawater. The fur seal is unique in showing both the bilateral SWS seen in most mammals and the asymmetric sleep previously reported in cetaceans [8]. Here we show that when the fur seal stays in seawater, where it spends most of its life [7], it goes without or greatly reduces REM sleep for days or weeks. After this nearly complete elimination of REM, it displays minimal or no REM rebound upon returning to baseline conditions. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that REM sleep may serve to reverse the reduced brain temperature and metabolism effects of bilateral nonREM sleep, a state that is greatly reduced when the fur seal is in the seawater, rather than REM sleep being directly homeostatically regulated. This can explain the absence of REM sleep in the dolphin and other cetaceans and its increasing proportion as the end of the sleep period approaches in humans and other mammals.},

Presumably, the whale was asleep during a significant portion of the time it spent lying on the bottom of the pool. Individual sleep episodes lasted between 20 and 492 s and on average occupied 66.7 {\textpm} 2.6\% of the nighttime (n = 8). Muscle jerks were quantified in the last three nights, during which an average of 144 {\textpm} 24 jerks were documented per night. Forty-six percent of all jerks occurred within 10 s of each other. Series of jerks lasted 2 -- 21 s (on average 4.8 {\textpm} 0.5 s, n = 97) and in total occupied 0.3 -- 0.7\% of the rest time (0.2 -- 0.5\% of total nighttime). Jerks occurred more frequently at the end of rest episodes. A significant portion of rest episodes with jerks (62\%) followed each other. These series of episodes with jerks alternated with periods when jerks were not recorded over 8 -- 37 min. We conclude that some jerks meet the behavioral criteria of paradoxical [or rapid eye movement (REM)] sleep (PS). On the other hand, definitive conclusions about the presence and duration of this sleep stage in cetaceans cannot be reached without further combined electropolygraphic studies and visual observations.

Several behaviors in this whale were grouped into 3 stages: (1) active wakefulness (mean 37.9 1.7\% of 24 hr during 6 consecutive days) included episodes of swimming in the main pool and in the shallow channel; (2) transitional stage (mean 17.4 1.4\%) was composed of quiescent at the surface or near the bottom and episodes of submerging and emerging to the surface; (3) rest on the bottom of the pool (mean 13.2 1.7\%) or at the surface (mean 28.0 1.7\%) during which the whale was almost completely immobile. Most apneas in this calf were {$<$}3 min. The mean respiratory pauses were 29.1 0.5 s (n=1615) in active wakefulness; 21.8 0.5 s (n=407) during series of submergings and emergings; 26.9 1.4 s (n=136) during quiescence at the surface, 92.5 2.5 s (n=236) near the bottom, 63.2 0.9 s (n=1030) during rest at the surface, and 147.4 5.0 s (n=377) on the bottom. In the rest stage, one eye could be open, tightly closed, or partially open. Characteristic muscle jerks and eyelid movements were documented in this whale during the rest stage. Most jerks were single, but in several cases jerks and eyelid movements followed each other resembling twitches characteristic of paradoxical sleep in terrestrial mammals. Our data suggested that large whales might have unihemispheric, slow-wave sleep and a low amount of paradoxical sleep, which occurs without muscle hypotonia, intensive jerks, and twitches.},

They are characterized by a number of traits which are considered plesiomorphic for the Artiodactyla order. The objective of this study was to examine sleep in the lesser mouse-deer (Tragulus kanchil), which is the smallest in this group (body mass {$<$} 2.2 kg). Electroencephalogram, nuchal electromyogram, electrooculogram, and body acceleration were recorded in four adult mouse-deer females using a telemetry system in Bu Gia Map National Park in Vietnam. The mouse-deer spent on average 49.7 {\textpm} 3.0\% of 24 h in nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. REM sleep occupied 1.7 {\textpm} 0.3\% of 24 h or 3.2 {\textpm} 0.5\% of total sleep time. The average duration of REM sleep episodes was 2.0 {\textpm} 0.2 min, the average maximum was 5.1 {\textpm} 1.1 min, and the longest episodes lasted 8 min. NREM sleep occurred in sternal recumbency with the head held above the ground while 64.7 {\textpm} 6.4\% of REM sleep occurred with the head resting on the ground. The eyes were open throughout most of the NREM sleep period. The mousedeer displayed polyphasic sleep and crepuscular peaks in activity (04:00--06:00 and 18:00--19:00). The largest amounts of NREM occurred in the morning (06:00--09:00) and the smallest before dusk (04:00--06:00). REM sleep occurred throughout most of the daylight hours (08:00--16:00) and in the first half of the night (19:00--02:00). We suggest that the pattern and timing of sleep in the lesser mouse-deer is adapted to the survival of a small herbivorous animal, subject to predation, living in high environmental temperatures in the tropical forest undergrowth.},

Electroencephalogram, nuchal electromyogram, electrooculogram, and body acceleration were recorded in four adult mouse-deer females using a telemetry system in Bu Gia Map National Park in Vietnam. The mouse-deer spent on average 49.7 {\textpm} 3.0\% of 24 h in nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. REM sleep occupied 1.7 {\textpm} 0.3\% of 24 h or 3.2 {\textpm} 0.5\% of total sleep time. The average duration of REM sleep episodes was 2.0 {\textpm} 0.2 min, the average maximum was 5.1 {\textpm} 1.1 min, and the longest episodes lasted 8 min. NREM sleep occurred in sternal recumbency with the head held above the ground while 64.7 {\textpm} 6.4\% of REM sleep occurred with the head resting on the ground. The eyes were open throughout most of the NREM sleep period. The mousedeer displayed polyphasic sleep and crepuscular peaks in activity (04:00--06:00 and 18:00--19:00). The largest amounts of NREM occurred in the morning (06:00--09:00) and the smallest before dusk (04:00--06:00). REM sleep occurred throughout most of the daylight hours (08:00--16:00) and in the first half of the night (19:00--02:00). We suggest that the pattern and timing of sleep in the lesser mouse-deer is adapted to the survival of a small herbivorous animal, subject to predation, living in high environmental temperatures in the tropical forest undergrowth.},

These features include unihemispheric slow wave sleep (USWS, also being unihemispheric waking), the ability to maintain movement for stabilization of the sleep posture and to briefly open one eye while having a sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) in one hemisphere. In vivo microdialysis studies suggest that acetylcholine release is required for cortical activation during USWS, and that monoamines are not required for USWS. The need to breathe, to maintain efficient thermoregulation, and to avoid predation have shaped the sleep patterns in semiaquatic fur seals as in fully aquatic cetaceans.},

  abstract = {It has been reported that adult ostriches displayed the longest episodes of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (up to 5 min) and more REM sleep (24\% of the nighttime) than any other bird species. If the mammalian ontogenetic trend exists in the ostrich, then the amounts of REM and the duration of sleep episodes in young ostriches may be greater than those reported in adults. We investigated sleep in 1.5--3.5 month old ostrich chicks. Recordings were conducted during nighttime (20:00--08:00), the main sleep period in ostriches, which are diurnal. The polygrams were scored in 4-s epochs for waking, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and REM sleep, as in other bird studies. REM sleep in ostrich chicks occurred during both cortical EEG activation and during slow waves, as was described in adult ostriches. The chicks spent 69.3\% {\textpm} 1.5\% of the night in NREM sleep. REM sleep occupied 14.1\% {\textpm} 1.8\% of the night or 16.8\% {\textpm} 2.0\% of nighttime sleep. Episodes of REM sleep lasted on average 10 {\textpm} 1 s and ranged between 4 and 40 s. Therefore, the total amount and duration of REM sleep episodes in ostrich chicks were substantially smaller than reported in adult ostriches while the amounts of NREM sleep did not greatly differ. The developmental profile of REM sleep ontogenesis in the ostrich may be remarkably different from what has been reported in all studied mammals and birds.},

On average active wakefulness (AW) occupied 20.4 9 2.0\% of the 24-h period; quiet wakefulness (QW) 54.9 92.5\%; slow wave sleep (SWS) 15.0 92.5\% and paradoxical sleep (PS) 9.7 9 2.0\%. Between 30 and 50\% (average 39.1 93.4\%) of total sleep time was spent in PS. From 8 to 31 episodes of PS were recorded per day (average 17 96 per day), with the longest episode lasting 20 min (average 5.6 90.5 min). Episodes of interhemispheric EEG asymmetry accounted for 5.5 9 1.3\% of total SWS time. Respiratory pauses in these animals varied in QW between 4 and 36 s (average 15.7 9 0.4 s), in SWS between 11 and 37 s (20.9 9 0.6 s) and in PS between 2 and 69 s (15.0 91.5 s). AW, QW, SWS and PS were approximately equally distributed between light (07:00--19:00) and dark time (19:00--07:00). The low amount of SWS with interhemispheric EEG asymmetry, the high proportion of PS in total sleep time and the nearly even distribution of sleep and wakefulness over the 24-h period could be both species-specific features and/or ontogenetic characteristics of the animals studied. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We showed that the white whale was the fifth species of Cetaceans, which exhibits unihemispheric slow wave sleep. We found that the eye contralateral to the sleeping hemisphere in this whale was usually closed (right eye, 52\% of the total sleep time in the contralateral hemisphere; left eye, 40\%) or in an intermediate state (31 and 46\%, respectively) while the ipsilateral eye was typically open (89 and 80\%). Episodes of bilateral eye closure in this whale occupied less than 2\% of the observation time and were usually recorded during waking (49\% of the bilateral eye closure time) or low amplitude sleep (48\%) and rarely in high amplitude sleep (3\%). In spite of the evident overall relationship between the sleeping hemisphere and eye state, EEG and eye position in this whale could be independent over short time periods (less than 1 min). Therefore, eye state alone may not accurately reflect sleep state in Cetaceans. Our data support the idea that unihemispheric sleep allows Cetaceans to monitor the environment. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Some of which have evolved protection by emitting odours, such as spp of parrot fish, or by emitting ink which anesthetizes the moray's sense of smell for several hrs. The sharp teeth of morays are adapted for grasping or swallowing. There are numerous spp of shrimps and fishes that form symbiotic relationships with morays, picking parasites and often cleaning the insides of the eels' mouths. Morays are potentially dangerous because of their teeth and size, however the danger only occurs when they are provoked, not if they are left alone.},

  abstract = {Most studies examining sleep in mammals are done under controlled conditions in laboratory/zoological facil\- ities with few studies being conducted in their natural environment. It is not always possible to record sleep polysomnographically (PSG) from animals in their natural environments, as PSG is invasive, requiring the sur\- gical implantation of electrodes on the surface of the brain. In contrast, actigraphy (ACT) has been shown to be a minimally-invasive method to objectively measure overall sleep times in some mammals, although not revealing specific sleep states. The aim of this study is two-fold, first, to measure sleep polysomnographically in freeroaming blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) under the most natural conditions possible, and second, to establish the degree of concordance between ACT and PSG recordings undertaken simultaneously in the same individuals. Here we examined sleep in the blue wildebeest, in a naturalistic setting, using both poly\- somnography (PSG) and actigraphy (ACT). PSG showed that total sleep time (TST) in the blue wildebeest for a 24-h period was 4.53 h ({\textpm}0.12 h), 4.26 h ({\textpm}0.11 h) spent in slow wave (non-REM) sleep and 0.28 h ({\textpm}0.01 h) spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, with 19.47 h ({\textpm}0.12 h) spent in Wake. ACT showed that the blue wildebeest spent 19.23 h ({\textpm}0.18 h) Active and 4.77 h ({\textpm}0.18 h) Inactive. For both animals studied, a fair agreement between the two techniques for sleep scoring was observed, with approximately 45\% of corre\- sponding epochs analyzed being scored as both sleep (using PSG) and inactive (using ACT).},

  abstract = {This review examines aspects of cetacean brain structure related to behaviour and evolution. Major considerations include cetacean brain-body allometry, structure of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampal formation, specialisations of the cetacean brain related to vocalisations and sleep phenomenology, paleoneurology, and brain-body allometry during cetacean evolution. These data are assimilated to demonstrate that there is no neural basis for the often-asserted high intellectual abilities of cetaceans. Despite this, the cetaceans do have volumetrically large brains. A novel hypothesis regarding the evolution of large brain size in cetaceans is put forward. It is shown that a combination of an unusually high number of glial cells and unihemispheric sleep phenomenology make the cetacean brain an efficient thermogenetic organ, which is needed to counteract heat loss to the water. It is demonstrated that water temperature is the major selection pressure driving an altered scaling of brain and body size and an increased actual brain size in cetaceans. A point in the evolutionary history of cetaceans is identified as the moment in which water temperature became a significant selection pressure in cetacean brain evolution. This occured at the Archaeoceti - modern cetacean faunal transition. The size, structure and scaling of the cetacean brain continues to be shaped by water temperature in extant cetaceans. The alterations in cetacean brain structure, function and scaling, combined with the imperative of producing offspring that can withstand the rate of heat loss experienced in water, within the genetic confines of eutherian mammal reproductive constraints, provides an explanation for the evolution of the large size of the cetacean brain. These observations provide an alternative to the widely held belief of a correlation between brain size and intelligence in cetaceans. {\copyright} 2006 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

Recycle. Fly less. Eat less meat. These are some of the ways that we've been told can slow climate change. But the inordinate emphasis on individual behavior is the result of a marketing campaign that has succeeded in placing the responsibility for fixing climate change squarely on the shoulders of individuals.Fossil fuel companies have followed the example of other industries deflecting blame (think "guns don't kill people, people kill people") or greenwashing (think of the beverage industry's "Crying Indian" commercials of the 1970s). Meanwhile, they've blocked efforts to regulate or price carbon emissions, run PR campaigns aimed at discrediting viable alternatives, and have abdicated their responsibility in fixing the problem they've created. The result has been disastrous for our planet.In The New Climate War, Mann argues that all is not lost. He draws the battle lines between the people and the polluters-fossil fuel companies, right-wing plutocrats, and petrostates. And he outlines a plan for forcing our governments and corporations to wake up and make real change, including: A common-sense, attainable approach to carbon pricing- and a revision of the well-intentioned but flawed currently proposed version of the Green New Deal;Allowing renewable energy to compete fairly against fossil fuelsDebunking the false narratives and arguments that have worked their way into the climate debate and driven a wedge between even those who support climate change solutionsCombatting climate doomism and despair-mongering With immensely powerful vested interests aligned in defense of the fossil fuel status quo, the societal tipping point won't happen without the active participation of citizens everywhere aiding in the collective push forward. This book will reach, inform, and enable citizens everywhere to join this battle for our planet.},

  abstract = {Individuals with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) often report sleep disturbances, which may be caused by changes in sleep architecture or reduced sleep quality (greater time awake after sleep onset, poorer sleep efficiency, and sleep stage proportion alterations). Sleep is beneficial for memory formation, and herein we examine whether altered sleep physiology following TBI has deleterious effects on sleep-dependent declarative memory consolidation. Participants learned a list of word pairs in the morning or evening, and recall was assessed 12-h later, following an interval awake or with overnight sleep. Young adult participants (18--22 years) were assigned to one of four experimental groups: TBI Sleep (n = 14), TBI Wake (n = 12), non-TBI Sleep (n = 15), non-TBI Wake (n = 15). Each TBI participant was {$>$}1 year post-injury. Sleep physiology was measured with polysomnography. Memory consolidation was assessed by comparing change in word-pair recall over 12-h intersession intervals. The TBI group spent a significantly greater proportion of the night in SWS than the non-TBI group at the expense of NREM1. The TBI group also had marginally lower EEG delta power during SWS in the central region. Intersession changes in recall were greater for intervals with sleep than without sleep in both groups. However, despite abnormal sleep stage proportions for individuals with a TBI history, there was no difference in the intersession change in recall following sleep for the TBI and non-TBI groups. In both Sleep groups combined, there was a positive correlation between Intersession Change and the proportion of the night in NREM2 + SWS. Overall, sleep composition is altered following TBI but such deficits do not yield insufficiencies in sleep-dependent memory consolidation.},

  abstract = {Background: The energy requirements of free-ranging marine mammals are challenging to measure due to cryptic and far-ranging feeding habits, but are important to quantify given the potential impacts of high-level predators on ecosystems. Given their large body size and carnivorous lifestyle, we would predict that northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) have elevated field metabolic rates (FMRs) that require high prey intake rates, especially during pregnancy. Disturbance associated with climate change or human activity is predicted to further elevate energy requirements due to an increase in locomotor costs required to accommodate a reduction in prey or time available to forage. In this study, we determined the FMRs, total energy requirements, and energy budgets of adult, female northern elephant seals. We also examined the impact of increased locomotor costs on foraging success in this species. Results: Body size, time spent at sea and reproductive status strongly influenced FMR. During the short foraging migration, FMR averaged 90.1 (SE = 1.7) kJ kg-1d-1 - only 36 \% greater than predicted basal metabolic rate. During the long migration, when seals were pregnant, FMRs averaged 69.4 ({\textpm}3.0) kJ kg-1d-1 - values approaching those predicted to be necessary to support basal metabolism in mammals of this size. Low FMRs in pregnant seals were driven by hypometabolism coupled with a positive feedback loop between improving body condition and reduced flipper stroking frequency. In contrast, three additional seals carrying large, non-streamlined instrumentation saw a four-fold increase in energy partitioned toward locomotion, resulting in elevated FMRs and only half the mass gain of normally-swimming study animals. Conclusions: These results highlight the importance of keeping locomotion costs low for successful foraging in this species. In preparation for lactation and two fasting periods with high demands on energy reserves, migrating elephant seals utilize an economical foraging strategy whereby energy savings from reduced locomotion costs are shuttled towards somatic growth and fetal gestation. Remarkably, the energy requirements of this species, particularly during pregnancy, are 70-80 \% lower than expected for mammalian carnivores, approaching or even falling below values predicted to be necessary to support basal metabolism in mammals of this size.},

Settler colonialism brought immense investments in fire suppression by the United States Forest Service and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention (CAL FIRE) to protect timber and structures, effectively limiting prescribed burning in California. Despite this, fire-dependent American Indian communities such as the Karuk and Yurok peoples, stalwartly advocate for expanding prescribed burning as a part of their efforts to revitalize their culture and sovereignty. To examine the political ecology of prescribed burning in Northern California, we coupled participant observation of prescribed burning in Karuk and Yurok territories (2015--2019) with 75 surveys and 18 interviews with Indigenous and non-Indigenous fire managers to identify political structures and material conditions that facilitate and constrain prescribed fire expansion. Managers report that interagency partnerships have provided supplemental funding and personnel to enable burning, and that decentralized prescribed burn associations facilitate prescribed fire. However, land dispossession and centralized state regulations undermine Indigenous and local fire governance. Excessive investment in suppression and the underfunding of prescribed fire produces a scarcity of personnel to implement and plan burns. Where Tribes and local communities have established burning infrastructure, authorities should consider the devolution of decision-making and land repatriation to accelerate prescribed fire expansion.},

However, the evolutionary origins of sleep remain ignored or misunderstood, which has led researchers to study, in various species, this common behaviour of all living organisms. Sleep is commonly studied at various levels under laboratory conditions, using tethered devices which record electroencephalographic or electromyographic readings. These artificial settings tend to induce stress, reduce animal freedom and prevent the use of sleeping shelters. In this paper, we present a novel, implantable instrumentation for a complete characterization of sleep under natural conditions suitable for a wide range of animal species, even for animals as small as pigeons or mice. Several configurations of this system are possible to enable the measurement of up to 16 electrophysiology channels, 3 temperature channels as well as 3-axes accelerometry. With an embedded flash memory card for the storage of data collected, the system can be used as a datalogger for the recording of signals in the field.},

  abstract = {Northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris, travel between colonies along the west coast of North America and foraging areas in the North Pacific. They also have the ability to return to their home colony after being experimentally translocated. However, the mechanisms of this navigation are not known. Visual information could serve an important role in navigation, either primary or supplementary. We examined the role of visual cues in elephant seal navigation by translocating three seals and recording their heading direction continuously using GPS, and acceleration and geomagnetic data loggers while they returned to the colony. The seals first reached the coast and then proceeded to the colony by swimming along the coast. While underwater the animals exhibited a horizontally straight course (mean net-to-gross displacement ratio=0.94{\textpm}0.02). In contrast, while at the surface they changed their headings up to 360 deg. These results are consistent with the use of visual cues for navigation to the colony. The seals may visually orient by using landmarks as they swim along the coast. We further assessed whether the seals could maintain a consistent heading while underwater during drift dives where one might expect that passive spiraling during drift dives could cause disorientation. However, seals were able to maintain the initial course heading even while underwater during drift dives where there was spiral motion (to within 20 deg). This behavior may imply the use of non-visual cues such as acoustic signals or magnetic fields for underwater orientation.},

  abstract = {Heart rate and peripheral blood flow distribution are the primary determinants of the rate and pattern of oxygen store utilisation and ultimately breath-hold duration in marine endotherms. Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea lions and fur seals) regulate heart rate (fH) while diving. We investigated dive fH in five adult female California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) during foraging trips by instrumenting them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth recorders. In all dives, dive fH (number of beats/duration; 50{\textpm}9 beats min(-1)) decreased compared with surface rates (113{\textpm}5 beats min(-1)), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous fH below resting ({$<$}54 beats min(-1)) at some point during the dive. Both dive fH and minimum instantaneous fH significantly decreased with increasing dive duration. Typical instantaneous fH profiles of deep dives ({$>$}100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial rapid decline in fH resulting in the lowest instantaneous fH of the dive at the end of descent, often below 10 beats min(-1) in dives longer than 6 min in duration; (2) a slight increase in fH to {\textasciitilde}10-40 beats min(-1) during the bottom portion of the dive; and (3) a gradual increase in fH during ascent with a rapid increase prior to surfacing. Thus, fH regulation in deep-diving sea lions is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reductions in pulmonary and peripheral blood flow during late descent of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservation of the lung oxygen store, (b) increase dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound oxygen store, (c) conserve the blood oxygen store and (d) help limit the absorption of nitrogen at depth. This fH profile during deep dives of sea lions may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspiration as similar fH profiles have been recently documented in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspiration.},

Many studies have focused on the extreme role of the dive response in maximizing dive duration in marine mammals, but few have addressed how these adjustments may compromise the capability to hunt, digest and thermoregulate during routine dives. Here, we use DTAGs, which record heart rate together with foraging and movement behaviour, to investigate how O2 management is balanced between the need to dive and forage in five wild harbour porpoises that hunt thousands of small prey daily during continuous shallow diving. Dive heart rates were moderate (median minimum 47--69 bpm) and relatively stable across dive types, dive duration (0.5--3.3 min) and activity. A moderate dive response, allowing for some perfusion of peripheral tissues, may be essential for fuelling the high field metabolic rates required to maintain body temperature and support digestion during diving in these small, continuously feeding cetaceans. Thus, despite having the capacity to prolong dives via a strong dive response, for these shallow-diving cetaceans, it appears to be more efficient to maintain circulation while diving: extreme heart rate gymnastics are for deep dives and emergencies, not everyday use.},

Investigations on northern elephant seals have shown lactation efficiency, measured as the proportion of total energy expenditure that goes to the pup as milk, increases with age. In a cross-sectional study the physiological and behavioral determinants of lactation efficiency were investigated in eight young and seven prime (older) elephant seals by conducting behavioral observations and collecting milk, blood, and tissue on days 3 and 22 of lactation. Milk composition, circulating fatty acid and triglyceride concentrations, and mammary and blubber lipoprotein lipase activity were determined. Prime females had significantly greater percent milk fat and circulating fatty acids on day 3 than did young females, but these differences disappeared by day 22. The ability for prime females to produce higher-energy milk early in lactation may allow them to increase lactation efficiency by increasing the rate of energy transfer. In addition, prime females spent significantly more time resting. A combination of reduced activity and more rapid energy delivery likely explains the increase in lactation efficiency with age found in a previous study. {\copyright} 2006 by The University of Chicago.

  abstract = {Rationale Stable isotope analysis of keratinized tissues is an informative tool for quantifying foraging ecology that can address questions related to niche specialization and temporal variation in behavior. Application of this approach relies on an understanding of tissue growth and how isotope ratios relate to physiological and ecological processes, data that are lacking for many species. Methods We collected paired whisker length measurements from northern elephant seals to estimate growth and shedding patterns (n = 16). A subset of seals (n = 5) carried a satellite tag and time--depth recorder across the 7+ month foraging trip following the annual pelage molt. Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen were measured in whisker segments grown across the 6+ week fasting on land and the subsequent foraging trip; profiles were combined with growth parameters to timestamp each segment and investigate relationships with foraging behavior. Results Whisker loss and initial regrowth primarily occurred during the annual pelage molt, but newly grown whiskers exhibited active, nonlinear growth across the foraging trip. The {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values were higher in segments grown on land than at sea and exhibited a characteristic decline upon departure from the rookery. There was a relationship between latitude and longitude and {$\delta$}15N values, and individual whisker segments grown at sea could be classified to the correct ecoregion with 81\% accuracy. Conclusions Fasting affected both {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values and the ability to exclude these values from ecological investigations is crucial given the temporal overlap with tissue growth. The rapid decline in isotope ratios upon departure can be used to isolate portions of the whisker with a strong physiological signal, even for whiskers with unknown growth histories. The active growth across the foraging trip combined with the ability to identify differences in foraging behavior validates the utility of this approach for addressing ecological questions.},

These anticipatory adjustments confirm that blood redistribution in seals is under some degree of cognitive control that precedes the mammalian dive response. Seals also routinely increase cerebral oxygenation at a consistent time during each dive, despite a lack of access to ambient air. We suggest that this frequent and reproducible reoxygenation pattern, without access to ambient air, is underpinned by previously unrecognised changes in cerebral drainage. The ability to track blood volume and oxygenation in different tissues using NIRS will facilitate a more accurate understanding of physiological plasticity in diving animals in an increasingly disturbed and exploited environment.},

  abstract = {Although energetics is fundamental to animal ecology, traditional methods of determining metabolic rate are neither direct nor instantaneous. Recently, continuous blood oxygen (O2) measurements were used to assess energy expenditure in diving elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris), demonstrating that an exceptional hypoxemic tolerance and exquisite management of blood O2 stores underlie the extraordinary diving capability of this consummate diver. As the detailed relationship of energy expenditure and dive behavior remains unknown, we integrated behavior, ecology, and physiology to characterize the costs of different types of dives of elephant seals. Elephant seal dive profiles were analyzed and O2 utilization was classified according to dive type (overall function of dive: transit, foraging, food processing/rest). This is the first account linking behavior at this level with in vivo blood O2 measurements in an animal freely diving at sea, allowing us to assess patterns of O2 utilization and energy expenditure between various behaviors and activities in an animal in the wild. In routine dives of elephant seals, the blood O2 store was significantly depleted to a similar range irrespective of dive function, suggesting that all dive types have equal costs in terms of blood O2 depletion. Here, we present the first physiological evidence that all dive types have similarly high blood O2 demands, supporting an energy balance strategy achieved by devoting one major task to a given dive, thereby separating dive functions into distinct dive types. This strategy may optimize O2 store utilization and recovery, consequently maximizing time underwater and allowing these animals to take full advantage of their underwater resources. This approach may be important to optimizing energy expenditure throughout a dive bout or at-sea foraging trip and is well suited to the lifestyle of an elephant seal, which spends {$>$} 90\% of its time at sea submerged making diving its most ``natural'' state.},

If mangroves were lost, 15 million more people would be flooded annually across the world. Some of the nations that receive the greatest economic benefits include the USA, China, India and Mexico. Vietnam, India and Bangladesh receive the greatest benefits in terms of people protected. Many ({$>$}45) 20-km coastal stretches particularly those near cities receive more than \$US 250\,million annually in flood protection benefits from mangroves. These results demonstrate the value of mangroves as natural coastal defenses at global, national and local scales, which can inform incentives for mangrove conservation and restoration in development, climate adaptation, disaster risk reduction and insurance.},

Recently, deep learning has substantially advanced automatic wildlife recognition. However, current methods are hampered by a dependence on large static datasets, whereas wildlife data are intrinsically dynamic and involve long-tailed distributions. These drawbacks can be overcome through a hybrid combination of machine learning and humans in the loop. Our proposed iterative human and automated identification approach is capable of learning from wildlife imagery data with a long-tailed distribution. Additionally, it includes self-updating learning, which facilitates capturing the community dynamics of rapidly changing natural systems. Extensive experiments show that our approach can achieve an {\textasciitilde}90\% accuracy employing only {\textasciitilde}20\% of the human annotations of existing approaches. Our synergistic collaboration of humans and machines transforms deep learning from a relatively inefficient post-annotation tool to a collaborative ongoing annotation tool that vastly reduces the burden of human annotation and enables efficient and constant model updates.},

  abstract = {The electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the oldest technologies to measure neuronal activity of the human brain. It has its undisputed value in clinical diagnosis, particularly (but not exclusively) in the identification of epilepsy and sleep disorders and in the evaluation of dysfunctions in sensory transmission pathways. With the advancement of digital technologies, the analysis of EEG has moved from pure visual inspection of amplitude and frequency modulations over time to a comprehensive exploration of the temporal and spatial characteristics of the recorded signals. Today, EEG is accepted as a powerful tool to capture brain function with the unique advantage of measuring neuronal processes in the time frame in which these processes occur, namely in the sub-second range. However, it is generally stated that EEG suffers from a poor spatial resolution that makes it difficult to infer to the location of the brain areas generating the neuronal activity measured on the scalp. This statement has challenged a whole community of biomedical engineers to offer solutions to localize more precisely and more reliably the generators of the EEG activity. High-density EEG systems combined with precise information of the head anatomy and sophisticated source localization algorithms now exist that convert the EEG to a true neuroimaging modality. With these tools in hand and with the fact that EEG still remains versatile, inexpensive and portable, electrical neuroimaging has become a widely used technology to study the functions of the pathological and healthy human brain. However, several steps are needed to pass from the recording of the EEG to 3-dimensional images of neuronal activity. This review explains these different steps and illustrates them in a comprehensive analysis pipeline integrated in a stand-alone freely available academic software: Cartool. The information about how the different steps are performed in Cartool is only meant as a suggestion. Other EEG source imaging software may apply similar or different approaches to the different steps.},

Using suction cup tags, we discovered that sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) worldwide conduct passive shallow 'drift-dives' in stereotypical vertical postures just below the sea surface. Bouts of drift-dives accounted for 7.1\% of recording time, or 36.7\% of non-foraging time. Drift-dives were weakly diurnal, occurring least from 06:00-12:00 (3\% of records), and most from 18:00-24:00 (30\% of records). A group of vertically drifting whales were atypically non-responsive to a closely-passing vessel until it inadvertently touched them, suggesting that sperm whales might sleep during these stereotypical resting dives. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

During sleep in air, short periods of continuous breathing (mean length = approximately 2.6 min) alternated with periods of apnea (mean length = approximately 6.1 min). Under hypoxic or hypercapnic conditions, the frequency of occurrence of apneas was reduced primarily due to the occurrence of some sleep episodes without periods of apnea. In episodes in which apneas did occur, they began later in the sleep episodes, but their length and the length of the periods of eupnea were not significantly altered. During each period of eupnea, however, the instantaneous respiratory rate and the total number of breaths increased. Breathing during sleep was restricted to SWS, never occurring during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, regardless of the respired gas mixture. If the levels of hypoxia and hypercapnia were raised further, all episodes of apnea during sleep could be eliminated together with all episodes of REM sleep. One interpretation of the data is that the threshold for altering breathing during eupnea (instantaneous breathing frequency and number of breaths per episode of eupnea) is lower than that for altering the lengths of the periods of apnea and eupnea and that the muscle atonia associated with REM sleep extends to all respiratory muscles.},

One interpretation of the data is that the threshold for altering breathing during eupnea (instantaneous breathing frequency and number of breaths per episode of eupnea) is lower than that for altering the lengths of the periods of apnea and eupnea and that the muscle atonia associated with REM sleep extends to all respiratory muscles.},

  abstract = {Existing methods for optimal control struggle to deal with the complexity commonly encountered in real-world systems, including dimensionality, process error, model bias and data heterogeneity. Instead of tackling these system complexities directly, researchers have typically sought to simplify models to fit optimal control methods. But when is the optimal solution to an approximate, stylized model better than an approximate solution to a more accurate model? While this question has largely gone unanswered owing to the difficulty of finding even approximate solutions for complex models, recent algorithmic and computational advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) might finally allow us to address these questions. DRL methods have to date been applied primarily in the context of games or robotic mechanics, which operate under precisely known rules. Here, we demonstrate the ability for DRL algorithms using deep neural networks to successfully approximate solutions (the "policy function" or control rule) in a non-linear three-variable model for a fishery without knowing or ever attempting to infer a model for the process itself. We find that the reinforcement learning agent discovers a policy that outperforms both constant escapement and constant mortality policies-the standard family of policies considered in fishery management. This DRL policy has the shape of a constant escapement policy whose escapement values depend on the stock sizes of other species in the model.},

  abstract = {Wildland fire modeling tools can ingest high resolution 3D vegetation models as inputs. However, data used to build the surface fuels in these models is often at a 30-meter resolution, which does not necessarily provide sufficient detail for accurate modeling of fires. Terrestrial laser scans are increasingly being used to collect detailed vegetation data that could be integrated with new approaches to fuel and fire modeling, but manual segmentation of scans is not scalable beyond a small number of scans. There is a need to automatically segment these high resolution point clouds as they are collected in the field, such that they may be leveraged by fuel and fire models for wildland fire response and mitigation and other applied climate science. This paper summarizes our early work on a labeling, visualization and machine learning pipeline for detailed segmentation of fuels. Specific contributions are: (1) a labeling approach involving 3 dimensional segmentation of point clouds using a point cloud processing engine; (2) a visualization approach using a computer graphics engine; and (3) early results from a deep learning modeling approach for fuel segmentation by category (live and dead) and size class (1, 10, 100 and 1000 hour fuels).},

  abstract = {We studied ventilatory and neurocirculatory responses to combined hypoxia (arterial O2 saturation 80\%) and hypercapnia (end-tidal CO2 + 5 Torr) in awake humans. This asphyxic stimulus produced a substantial increase in minute ventilation (6.9 +/- 0.4 to 20.0 +/- 1.5 l/min) that promptly subsided on return to room air breathing. During asphyxia, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (intraneural microelectrodes) increased to 220 +/- 28\% of the room air baseline. Approximately two-thirds of this sympathetic activation persisted after return to room air breathing for the duration of our measurements (20 min in 8 subjects, 1 h in 2 subjects). In contrast, neither ventilation nor sympathetic outflow changed during time control experiments. A 20-min exposure to hyperoxic hypercapnia also caused a sustained increase in sympathetic activity, but, unlike the aftereffect of asphyxia, this effect was short lived and coincident with continued hyperpnea. In summary, relatively brief periods of asphyxic stimulation cause substantial increases in sympathetic vasomotor outflow that outlast the chemical stimuli. These findings provide a potential explanation for the chronically elevated sympathetic nervous system activity that accompanies sleep apnea syndrome.},

In addition, a postprocessing scheme on decision level was applied that provided an improvement in the performance of more than 1\%, mainly in cases of low ratios of sound-to-noise. Finally, we evaluated a late-stage fusion method, combining the postprocessed recognition results of the three top-performing classifiers, and the experimental results showed a further improvement of approximately 2\%, in terms of absolute improvement, with logging sound recognition accuracy reaching 94.42\% when the ratio of sound-to-noise was equal to 20 dB.},

However, a recent electrophysiological investigation of manatee (Trichechus manatus) hearing has shown their temporal resolution to be better than expected, leading to speculation that enhanced temporal processing capabilities are adaptive for underwater sound localization. This study measured evoked responses from several California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), a harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), and a northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) to determine how well the auditory systems of these amphibious mammals resolve rhythmic stimuli. Trains of broadband clicks were presented in air at repetition rates from 125 to 1,500 s-1, and the averaged evoked responses elicited by these stimuli were recorded from the skin. Rate-following responses were detected in the sea lions at rates up to 1,000 s-1, with an estimated upper limit of temporal resolution between 875 to 1,000 s-1. This upper limit is better than previously anticipated and was further substantiated by limited testing with the harbor seal and northern elephant seal. While these findings might support an underwater sound localization hypothesis, measurements comparable to those of the pinnipeds were also obtained in a phylogenetically similar terrestrial mammal: a domestic dog (Canis familiaris). It is therefore possible that increased temporal resolution in pinnipeds and other nonecholocating marine mammals is not a result of the evolutionary pressure of an aquatic environment.},

Myctophidae). The foraging behaviour of the northern elephant seal contrasts with echolocating toothed whales, which make fewer feeding attempts, suggesting the whales forage more selectively. We hypothesize that the continuous diving mode exhibited by this seal could be attributed to their reliance on small prey and their less efficient `passive sensors' for prey search, that is, their vision or whiskers to detect prey.},

  abstract = {Background Although much is known about the behavior of white sharks in coastal regions, very little is known about their vertical movements offshore in the eastern Pacific where they spend up to five months. We provide the first detailed description of the offshore habitat use of white sharks in the eastern North Pacific. Methodology/Principal Findings This study uses 2-min data from four recovered pop-up satellite archival tags deployed at Guadalupe Island (2002 and 2005). Deployments ranged from 5.4 to 8.2 months. Two predominant vertical patterns were described. The first was a bimodal vertical pattern with time spent at the surface and at depth, which was observed while traveling. The second was a repetitive oscillatory diving mode displayed by sharks in the Shared Offshore Foraging Area (SOFA). For all four datasets the average maximum daily dive depths ranged from 442.5 to 492.8 m and were typically associated with dissolved oxygen concentrations of above 1.7 ml L-1. Although infrequent, occasional dives to near 1000 m with a minimum temperature of 3.9{$^\circ$}C and a minimum O2 level of 0.3 ml L-1 were observed. Conclusions/Significance Recovered pop-up satellite tags from Guadalupe Island white sharks advance our understanding of the vertical habitat use of white sharks while offshore. The bimodal vertical pattern during traveling is most likely related to geolocation. The oscillatory dive pattern is likely associated with foraging. While feeding is not documented, foraging is likely occurring in association with the deep scattering layer. Diving depths were not limited by temperature but were constrained by O2 levels below approximately 1.5 ml L-1. While oxygen may limit the extent of sharks' vertical movements, it will also impact prey distribution. Consequently, the shallow oxygen minimum zone in the SOFA may act to concentrate prey, thus enhancing foraging opportunities in these oligotrophic waters.},

  abstract = {Understanding the interaction between the nervous system and cerebral vasculature is fundamental to forming a complete picture of the neurophysiology of sleep and its role in maintaining physiological homeostasis. However, the intrinsic hemodynamics of slow-wave sleep (SWS) are still poorly known. We carried out 30 all-night sleep measurements with combined near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and polysomnography to investigate spontaneous hemodynamic behavior in SWS compared to light (LS) and rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM). In particular, we concentrated on slow oscillations (3-150 mHz) in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations, heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, and the pulsation amplitude of the photoplethysmographic signal. We also analyzed the behavior of these variables during sleep stage transitions. The results indicate that slow spontaneous cortical and systemic hemodynamic activity is reduced in SWS compared to LS, REM, and wakefulness. This behavior may be explained by neuronal synchronization observed in electrophysiological studies of SWS and a reduction in autonomic nervous system activity. Also, sleep stage transitions are asymmetric, so that the SWS-to-LS and LS-to-REM transitions, which are associated with an increase in the complexity of cortical electrophysiological activity, are characterized by more dramatic hemodynamic changes than the opposite transitions. Thus, it appears that while the onset of SWS and termination of REM occur only as gradual processes over time, the termination of SWS and onset of REM may be triggered more abruptly by a particular physiological event or condition. The results suggest that scalp hemodynamic changes should be considered alongside cortical hemodynamic changes in NIRS sleep studies to assess the interaction between the autonomic and central nervous systems. {\copyright} 2011 N{\"a}si et al.},

  abstract = {Objective: Current mainstream EEG electrode setups permit efficient recordings, but are often bulky and uncomfortable for subjects. Here we introduce a novel type of EEG electrode, which is designed for an optimal wearing comfort. The electrode is referred to as C-electrode where "C" stands for comfort. Methods: The C-electrode does not require any holder/cap for fixation on the head nor does it use traditional pads/lining of disposable electrodes - thus, it does not disturb subjects. Fixation of the C-electrode on the scalp is based entirely on the adhesive interaction between the very light C-electrode/wire construction ({$<$}35 mg) and a droplet of EEG paste/gel. Moreover, because of its miniaturization, both C-electrode (diameter 2-3 mm) and a wire (diameter {$\sim$}50 {$\mu$}m) are minimally (or not at all) visible to an external observer. EEG recordings with standard and C-electrodes were performed during rest condition, self-paced movements and median nerve stimulation. Results: The quality of EEG recordings for all three types of experimental conditions was similar for standard and C-electrodes, i.e., for near-DC recordings (Bereitschaftspotential), standard rest EEG spectra (1-45 Hz) and very fast oscillations {$\sim$}600 Hz (somatosensory evoked potentials). The tests showed also that once being placed on a subject's head, C-electrodes can be used for 9 h without any loss in EEG recording quality. Furthermore, we showed that C-electrodes can be effectively utilized for Brain-Computer Interfacing. C-electrodes proved to posses a high stability of mechanical fixation (stayed attached with 2.5 g accelerations). Subjects also reported not having any tactile sensations associated with wearing of C-electrodes. Conclusion: C-electrodes provide optimal wearing comfort without any loss in the quality of EEG recordings. Significance: We anticipate that C-electrodes can be used in a wide range of clinical, research and emerging neuro-technological environments. {\copyright} 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

  abstract = {Organisms living in urban environments are exposed to different environmental conditions compared to their rural conspecifics. Especially anthropogenic noise and artificial night light are closely linked to urbanization and pose new challenges to urban species. Songbirds are particularly affected by these factors, because they rely on the spread of acoustic information and adjust their behaviour to the rhythm of night and day, e.g. time their dawn song according to changing light intensities. Our aim was to clarify the specific contributions of artificial night light and traffic noise on the timing of dawn song of urban European Blackbirds (Turdus merula). We investigated the onset of blackbird dawn song along a steep urban gradient ranging from an urban forest to the city centre of Leipzig, Germany. This gradient of anthropogenic noise and artificial night light was reflected in the timing of dawn song. In the city centre, blackbirds started their dawn song up to 5 hours earlier compared to those in semi-natural habitats. We found traffic noise to be the driving factor of the shift of dawn song into true night, although it was not completely separable from the effects of ambient night light. We additionally included meteorological conditions into the analysis and found an effect on the song onset. Cloudy and cold weather delayed the onset, but cloud cover was assumed to reflect night light emissions, thus, amplified sky luminance and increased the effect of artificial night light. Beside these temporal effects, we also found differences in the spatial autocorrelation of dawn song onset showing a much higher variability in noisy city areas than in rural parks and forests. These findings indicate that urban hazards such as ambient noise and light pollution show a manifold interference with naturally evolved cycles and have significant effects on the activity patterns of urban blackbirds.},

  abstract = {Coral reefs are effective natural flood barriers that protect adjacent coastal communities. As the need to adapt to rising sea levels, storms, and environmental changes increases, reef restoration may be one of the best tools available to mitigate coastal flooding along tropical coastlines, now and in the future. Reefs act as a barrier to incoming short-wave energy but can amplify low-frequency infragravity waves that, in turn, drive coastal flooding along low-lying tropical coastlines. Here, we investigate whether the spacing of reef restoration elements can be optimized to maximize infragravity wave energy dissipation while minimizing the number of elements---a key factor in the cost of a restoration project. With this goal, we model the hydrodynamics of infragravity wave dissipation over a coral restoration or artificial reef, represented by a canopy of idealized hemispherical roughness elements, using a three-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations solver (OpenFOAM). The results demonstrate that denser canopies of restoration elements produce greater wave dissipation under larger waves with longer periods. Wave dissipation is also frequency-dependent: dense canopies remove wave energy at the predominant wave frequency, whereas sparse canopies remove energy at higher frequencies, and hence are less efficient. We also identify an inflection point in the canopy density--energy dissipation curve that balances optimal energy losses with a minimum number of canopy elements. Through this work, we show that there are an ideal number of restoration elements per across-shore meter of coral reef flat that can be installed to dissipate infragravity wave energy for given incident heights and periods. These results have implications for designing coral reef restoration projects on reef flats that are effective both from a coastal defense and costing standpoint.},

The role of indigenous knowledge in offering an effective risk reduction strategy towards flood disaster disregarded for many decades is now gaining global recognition. There is a growing call for empirical identification of the effectiveness of indigenous knowledge in flood risk reduction. Consequently, this paper empirically examines indigenous flood control and management knowledge with the intent to identify its effectiveness in risk reduction of flood disasters in Nigeria's coastal communities. This is to provide empirical bases for the formulation of appropriate strategies for enhancing flood risk reduction in Nigeria's coastal communities. The research engaged focus group discussion and questionnaire methods to generate primary data. The research proceeds with principal component analysis to classify and measure the effectiveness of indigenous flood control and management knowledge in flood risk reduction. The result shows the existence of eight types of indigenous flood control and management knowledge in the coastal communities and they were 61.2\% effective in flood risk reduction. This implies that indigenous flood control and management knowledge practiced in Nigeria's coastal communities is effective in flood risk reduction. This study proposed a sustainable approach to risk reduction in flood disasters based on the integration of indigenous knowledge systems and modern flood management strategies.},

Among infants with IVH about 35\% develop posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PPH) which may lead to secondary injury. Therapeutic interventions to reduce the increased intracranial pressure are invasive and carry a high risk of complications. Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) allows continuous neurophysiological surveillance and may help in defining the optimal timing for intervention in infants with progressive PHH. In this report we show, for the first time, a change in aEEG activity in two preterm infants with PHH. Methods: Cerebral activity was continuously monitored by aEEG provided by the Cerebral Function Monitor (Lectromed, UK) in two preterm infants with PPH. Results: With increasing ventricular width, aEEG showed an increased discontinuity without distinguishable sleep-wake cycling in both infants. One infant showed an abrupt onset of a nearly isoelectric pattern without any change in clinical condition. Clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure developed 6-12 h later in both children. In one patient, aEEG activity returned to normal after successful shunting and reduction of intracranial pressure. Conclusion: Continuous neurophysiological monitoring by aEEG may be of value in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of preterm infants with progressive PHH.},

Results demonstrate that although such representations have much potential for attracting people's attention to climate change, fear is generally an ineffective tool for motivating genuine personal engagement. Nonthreatening imagery and icons that link to individuals' everyday emotions and concerns in the context of this macro-environmental issue tend to be the most engaging.

  abstract = {Ontogeny of diving and foraging behavior in marine top predators is poorly understood despite its importance in population recruitment. This lack of knowledge is partly due to the difficulties of monitoring juveniles in the wild, which is linked to high mortality early in life. Pinnipeds are good models for studying the development of foraging behaviors because juveniles are large enough to robustly carry tracking devices for many months. Moreover, parental assistance is absent after a juvenile departs for its first foraging trip, minimizing confounding effects of parental input on the development of foraging skills. In this study, we tracked 20 newly weaned juvenile southern elephant seals from Kerguelen Islands for up to 338~days during their first trip at sea following weaning. We used a new generation of satellite relay tags, which allow for the transmission of dive, accelerometer, and location data. We also monitored, at the same time, nine adult females from the colony during their post-breeding trips, in order to compare diving and foraging behaviors. Juveniles showed a gradual improvement through time in their foraging skills. Like adults females, they remarkably adjusted their swimming effort according to temporal changes in buoyancy (i.e., a proxy of their body condition). They also did not appear to exceed their aerobic physiological diving limits, although dives were constrained by their smaller size compared to adults. Changes in buoyancy appeared to also influence their decision to either keep foraging or return to land, alongside the duration of their haul outs and choice of foraging habitat (oceanic vs. plateau). Further studies are thus needed to better understand how patterns in juveniles survival, and therefore elephant seal populations, might be affected by their changes in foraging skills and changes in their environmental conditions.},

Numerous studies have been conducted to explore public attitudes toward animal use, and more specifically the use of animals in research. This paper reviews relevant literature using three categories of influential factors: personal and cultural characteristics, animal characteristics, and research characteristics. Abstract: The exploration of public attitudes toward animal research is important given recent developments in animal research (e.g., increasing creation and use of genetically modified animals, and plans for progress in areas such as personalized medicine), and the shifting relationship between science and society (i.e., a move toward the democratization of science). As such, public engagement on issues related to animal research, including exploration of public attitudes, provides a means of achieving socially acceptable scientific practice and oversight through an understanding of societal values and concerns. Numerous studies have been conducted to explore public attitudes toward animal use, and more specifically the use of animals in research. This paper reviews relevant literature using three categories of influential factors: personal and cultural characteristics, animal characteristics, and research characteristics. A critique is given of survey style methods used to collect data on public attitudes, and recommendations are given on how best to address current gaps in public attitudes literature.},

Axial Dependent Modular Electrode Mount (ADMEM), as designed here, addresses the aforementioned constraints by using light-weight and adjustable materials. The initial prototype of ADMEM has been tested in vivo with rat pups, using the open field test to assess for stress and anxiety at two post-installation time-points: one day after ADMEM installation (acute time-point) and four days after ADMEM installation (sub-acute time-point). There was no significant difference in normal developmental weight gain between Control and ADMEM rat groups. Although no significant difference was found in the level of anxiety between groups at the acute time-point, the ADMEM group spent significantly less time in the center of the open Held test, suggesting higher anxiety. The test also showed no difference in the measured traveled distances between Control and ADMEM groups on either time-points.},

Imaging toxicity is no simple task as many pollutants are invisible and sites of contamination are concealed, especially for those of privilege. Contemporary artists who attempt this challenge are often criticized that the beauty of their images obfuscates the health and environmental risk of the polluted sites they photograph. In response, this essay introduces the concept of the toxic sublime as a means of analyzing the tensions arising from visual representations of environmental contamination: beauty and ugliness, magnitude and insignificance, the known and the unknown, inhabitation and desolation, security and risk. The essay charts the evolution of the sublime in the US, describing how it has evolved from sites of nature to sites of technology to human damaged landscapes, some of which produce a toxic sublime. Through a close examination of Manufactured Landscapes, a twenty-five year retrospective of the images of noted environmental photographer Edward Burtynsky, this essay extends our understanding of the invention of the sublime in images, reconceptualizes the sublime response to contaminated places, as well as adding to our knowledge of how visual texts function to encourage contemplation of the viewers' position within a polluted world.},

  abstract = {Background: Global positioning systems (GPS) and altimeters are increasingly used to monitor vertical space use by aerial species, a key aspect of their ecological niche, that we need to know to manage our own use of the airspace, and to protect those species. However, there are various sources of error in flight height data ("height" above ground, as opposed to "altitude" above a reference like the sea level). First the altitude is measured with a vertical error from the devices themselves. Then there is error in the ground elevation below the tracked animals, which translates into error in flight height computed as the difference between altitude and ground elevation. Finally, there is error in the horizontal position of the animals, which translates into error in the predicted ground elevation below the animals. We used controlled field trials, simulations, and the reanalysis of raptor case studies with state-space models to illustrate the effect of improper error management. Results: Errors of a magnitude of 20 m appear in benign conditions for barometric altimeters and GPS vertical positioning (expected to be larger in more challenging context). These errors distort the shape of the distribution of flight heights, inflate the variance in flight height, bias behavioural state assignments, correlations with environmental covariates, and airspace management recommendations. Improper data filters such as removing all negative flight height records introduce several biases in the remaining dataset, and preclude the opportunity to leverage unambiguous errors to help with model fitting. Analyses that ignore the variance around the mean flight height, e.g., those based on linear models of flight height, and those that ignore the variance inflation caused by telemetry errors, lead to incorrect inferences. Conclusion: The state-space modelling framework, now in widespread use by ecologists and increasingly often automatically implemented within on-board GPS data processing algorithms, makes it possible to fit flight models directly to the output of GPS devices, with minimal data pre-selection, and to analyse the full distribution of flight heights, not just the mean. In addition to basic research about aerial niches, behaviour quantification, and environmental interactions, we highlight the applied relevance of our recommendations for airspace management and the conservation of aerial wildlife.},

However, although homozygosity for a membrane-bound receptor was more frequent in patients (25\%) than controls (10\%), other genotypes that would produce the same phenotype were not more frequent in patients than controls.The data provide little evidence that KIR polymorphism plays a role in predisposition to RSA.},

  abstract = {The Concorde produces audible sonic booms as it passes 15 km north of Sable Island, Nova Scotia, where gray and harbor seals occur year round. The purpose of this research was to assess how sonic booms affect these seals. The intensity of the booms was measured and three types of data (beach counts, frequency of behavior, and heart rate) were collected before and after booms during the breeding seasons of the two species. In addition to the data taken during breeding, beach counts were made before and after booms during the gray seal moult. The greatest range in overpressure within a single boom was 2.70 psf during gray seal breeding and 2.07 psf during harbor seal breeding. No significant differences were found in the behavior or beach counts of gray seals following sonic booms, regardless of the season. Beach counts and most behaviors of harbor seals also did not differ significantly following booms, however, harbor seals became more vigilant. The heart rates of four gray seal mothers and three pups showed no clear change as a result of booms, but six male harbor seals showed a nonsignificant tendency toward elevated heart rates during the 15-s interval of the boom. These results suggest sonic booms produced by the Concorde, in level flight at altitude and producing on average a sonic boom of 0.9 psf, do not substantially affect the breeding behavior of gray or harbor seals.},

  abstract = {The popularity of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) has risen sharply in recent years. Despite this spike in popularity, the inner workings of ML and DL algorithms are often perceived as opaque, and their relationship to classical data analysis tools remains debated. Although it is often assumed that ML and DL excel primarily at making predictions, ML and DL can also be used for analytical tasks traditionally addressed with statistical models. Moreover, most recent discussions and reviews on ML focus mainly on DL, failing to synthesise the wealth of ML algorithms with different advantages and general principles. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the field of ML and DL, starting by summarizing its historical developments, existing algorithm families, differences to traditional statistical tools, and universal ML principles. We then discuss why and when ML and DL models excel at prediction tasks and where they could offer alternatives to traditional statistical methods for inference, highlighting current and emerging applications for ecological problems. Finally, we summarize emerging trends such as scientific and causal ML, explainable AI, and responsible AI that may significantly impact ecological data analysis in the future. We conclude that ML and DL are powerful new tools for predictive modelling and data analysis. The superior performance of ML and DL algorithms compared to statistical models can be explained by their higher flexibility and automatic data-dependent complexity optimization. However, their use for causal inference is still disputed as the focus of ML and DL methods on predictions creates challenges for the interpretation of these models. Nevertheless, we expect ML and DL to become an indispensable tool in ecology and evolution, comparable to other traditional statistical tools.},

We use an oxygen-constrained, game-theoretic food-web model to simulate diel vertical migrations and estimate near-global (global ocean minus coastal areas and high latitudes) carbon fluxes and sequestration by fish and zooplankton due to respiration, fecal pellets, and deadfalls. Our model provides estimates of the carbon export and sequestration potential for a range of pelagic functional groups, despite uncertain biomass estimates of some functional groups. While the export production of metazoans and fish is modest ({$\sim$}20 \% of global total), we estimate that their contribution to carbon sequestered by the biological pump ({$\sim$}800 PgC) is conservatively more than 50 \% of the estimated global total ({$\sim$}1300 PgC) and that they have a significantly longer sequestration timescale ({$\sim$}250 years) than previously reported for other components of the biological pump. Fish and multicellular zooplankton contribute about equally to this sequestered carbon pool. This essential ecosystem service could be at risk from both unregulated fishing on the high seas and ocean deoxygenation due to climate change.},

  abstract = {Study Objectives: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) of the obstructive type causes hemodynamic consequences, leading to an increased cerebrovascular risk. The severity of SDB at which detrimental circulatory consequences appear is matter of controversy. Aim of the present study is the investigation of cerebral hemodynamics in patients with SDB of variable severity using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Design: N/A. Setting: Sleep laboratory. Patients or Participants: Nineteen patients with SDB. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Patients underwent nocturnal videopolysomnography (VPSG) coupled with cerebral NIRS. NIRS data were averaged for each patient, and a new method (integral) was applied to quantify cerebral hemodynamic alterations. Nocturnal VPSG disclosed various severities of SDB: snoring (7 patients, apnea-hypopnea index AHI = 2 2/h, range: 0.54.5); mild SDB (7 patients, AHI = 14 8/h, range: 6.328.6); and severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (5 patients, AHI = 79 20/h, range: 39.692.9). Relative changes of NIRS parameters were significantly larger during obstructive apneas (compared with hypopneas; mean deoxygenated hemoglobin HHb change of 0.72 0.23 and 0.13 0.08 {$\mu$}mol/L per sec, p value = 0.048) and in patients with severe SDB (as compared with patients with mild SDB and simple snorers; mean HHb change of 0.84 0.24, 0.02 0.09, and 0.2 0.08 {$\mu$}mol/L per sec, respectively, p value = 0.020). In this group, NIRS and concomitant changes in peripheral oxygen saturation correlated. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that acute cerebral hemodynamic consequences of SDB lead to a failure of autoregulatory mechanisms with brain hypoxia only in the presence of frequent apneas (AHI {$>$} 30) and obstructive events.

Analysis of blood samples from penguins at rest revealed arterial P(O(2))s and O(2) contents of 68+/-7 mmHg (1 mmHg= 133.3 Pa) and 22.5+/-1.3 ml O(2) dl(-1) (N=3) and venous values of 41+/-10 mmHg and 17.4+/-2.9 ml O(2) dl(-1) (N=9). Corresponding arterial and venous Hb saturations for a hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of 18 g dl(-1) were {$>$}91\% and 70\%, respectively. Analysis of P(O(2)) profiles obtained from birds equipped with intravascular P(O(2)) electrodes and backpack recorders during dives revealed that (1) the decline of the final blood P(O(2)) of a dive in relation to dive duration was variable, (2) final venous P(O(2)) values spanned a 40-mmHg range at the previously measured aerobic dive limit (ADL; dive duration associated with onset of post-dive blood lactate accumulation), (3) final arterial, venous and previously measured air sac P(O(2)) values were indistinguishable in longer dives, and (4) final venous P(O(2)) values of longer dives were as low as 1-6 mmHg during dives. Although blood O(2) is not depleted at the ADL, nearly complete depletion of the blood O(2) store occurs in longer dives. This extreme hypoxemic tolerance, which would be catastrophic in many birds and mammals, necessitates biochemical and molecular adaptations, including a shift in the O(2)-Hb dissociation curve of the emperor penguin in comparison to those of most birds. A relatively higher-affinity Hb is consistent with blood P(O(2)) values and O(2) contents of penguins at rest.},

  abstract = {In this study we examined behavioral sleep in the walrus, the only living species of the family Odobenidae. The behavior of four 1.5--2-year-old captive walruses was videotaped continuously for 7--17 days and scored in 1-min epochs. When walruses had access to water and land, behavioral sleep, the combined amount of quiet and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, occupied on average 17 {\textpm} 4\% of 24 h (n = 4) with the majority of sleep occurring on land. All walruses alternated periods of almost continuous swimming lasting for 40--84 h with periods of rest on land lasting for 2--19 h. When in water they were predominantly awake (88--99\% of the time). On land walruses were asleep on average 40--74\% of the time. The total sleep time varied between 0 and 60\% of 24 h with the daily amount of REM sleep ranging from 0 to 5\% of 24 h. In water, walruses slept while floating at the surface, lying on the bottom or standing and leaning against the pool wall. REM sleep in water occurred in all positions. On land the breathing pattern was regular during quiet sleep (most pauses were {$<$}30 s) and arrhythmic in REM sleep (apneas lasted up to 160 s). While in water the irregularity of breathing further increased (apneas were {$>$}4 min) and all REM sleep episodes occurred during a single apnea. Data indicate that the pattern of sleep and breathing in walruses is similar to the Otariidae seals while on land and the Phocidae seals while in water.},

The potential for this disease was first recognized in a human case study of temporal lobe epilepsy after the 1987 amnesic shellfish-poisoning event in Quebec, and was characterized as a chronic epileptic syndrome in California sea lions through investigation of a series of domoic acid poisoning cases between 1998 and 2006. The sea lion study provided a breadth of insight into clinical presentations, unusual behaviors, brain pathology, and epidemiology. A rat model that replicates key observations of the chronic epileptic syndrome in sea lions has been applied to identify the progression of the epileptic disease state, its relationship to behavioral manifestations, and to define the neural systems involved in these behavioral disorders. Here, we present the concept of domoic acid epileptic disease as a delayed manifestation of domoic acid poisoning and review the state of knowledge for this disease state in affected humans and sea lions. We discuss causative mechanisms and neural underpinnings of disease maturation revealed by the rat model to present the concept for olfactory origin of an epileptic disease; triggered in dendodendritic synapases of the olfactory bulb and maturing in the olfactory cortex. We conclude with updated information on populations at risk, medical diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.},

  abstract = {Birds are the only taxonomic group other than mammals that exhibit high-amplitude slow-waves in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during sleep. This defining feature of slow-wave sleep (SWS) apparently evolved independently in mammals and birds, as reptiles do not exhibit similar EEG activity during sleep. In mammals, the level of slow-wave activity (SWA) (low-frequency spectral power density) during SWS increases and decreases as a function of prior time spent awake and asleep, respectively, and therefore reflects homeostatically regulated sleep processes potentially tied to the function of SWS. Although birds also exhibit SWS, previous sleep deprivation studies in birds did not detect a compensatory increase in SWS-related SWA during recovery, as observed in similarly sleep-deprived mammals. This suggested that, unlike mammalian SWS, avian SWS is not homeostatically regulated, and therefore might serve a different function. However, we recently demonstrated that SWA during SWS increases in pigeons following short-term sleep deprivation. Herein we summarize research on avian sleep homeostasis, and cast our evidence for this phenomenon within the context of theories for the function of SWS in mammals. We propose that the convergent evolution of homeostatically regulated SWS in mammals and birds was directly linked to the convergent evolution of large, heavily interconnected brains capable of performing complex cognitive processes in each group. Specifically, as has been proposed for mammals, the interconnectivity that forms the basis of complex cognition in birds may also instantiate slow, synchronous network oscillations during SWS that in turn maintain interconnectivity and cognition at an optimal level.},

  abstract = {Several animals mitigate the fundamental conflict between sleep and wakefulness by engaging in unihemispheric sleep, a unique state during which one cerebral hemisphere sleeps while the other remains awake. Among mammals, unihemispheric sleep is restricted to aquatic species (Cetaceans, eared seals and manatees). In contrast to mammals, unihemispheric sleep is widespread in birds, and may even occur in reptiles. Unihemispheric sleep allows surfacing to breathe in aquatic mammals and predator detection in birds. Despite the apparent utility in being able to sleep unihemispherically, very few mammals sleep in this manner. This is particularly interesting since the reptilian ancestors to mammals may have slept unihemispherically. The relative absence of unihemispheric sleep in mammals suggests that a trade off exists between unihemispheric sleep and other adaptive brain functions occurring during sleep or wakefulness. Presumably, the benefits of sleeping unihemispherically only outweigh the costs under extreme circumstances such as sleeping at sea. Ultimately, a greater understanding of the reasons for little unihemispheric sleep in mammals promises to provide insight into the functions of sleep, in general. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {The functions of sleep remain an unresolved question in biology. One approach to revealing sleep's purpose is to identify traits that explain why some species sleep more than others. Recent comparative studies of sleep have identified relationships between various physiological, neuroanatomical and ecological traits, and the time mammals spend in rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep. However, owing to technological constraints, these studies were based exclusively on animals in captivity. Consequently, it is unclear to what extent the unnatural laboratory environment affected time spent sleeping, and thereby the identification and interpretation of informative clues to the functions of sleep. We performed the first electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of sleep on unrestricted animals in the wild using a recently developed miniaturized EEG recorder, and found that brown-throated three-toed sloths (               Bradypus variegatus               ) inhabiting the canopy of a tropical rainforest only sleep 9.63{$\mkern1mu$}h{$\mkern1mu$}d               -1               , over 6{$\mkern1mu$}h less than previously reported in captivity. Although the influence of factors such as the age of the animals studied cannot be ruled out, our results suggest that sleep in the wild may be markedly different from that in captivity. Additional studies of various species are thus needed to determine whether the relationships between sleep duration and various traits identified in captivity are fundamentally different in the wild. Our initial study of sloths demonstrates the feasibility of this endeavour, and thereby opens the door to comparative studies of sleep occurring within the ecological context within which it evolved.},

As with any biological process, the functions of sleep can only be fully understood when examined in the ecological context in which they evolved.

However, new tools are enabling researchers to study sleep behaviour and neurophysiology in the wild. Here, we summarize the various methods that have enabled sleep researchers to go wild, their strengths and weaknesses, and the discoveries resulting from these first steps outside the laboratory. The initial studies to `go wild' have revealed a wealth of interindividual variation in sleep, and shown that sleep duration is not even fixed within an individual, but instead varies in response to an assortment of ecological demands. Determining the costs and benefits of this inter- and intraindividual variation in sleep may reveal clues to the functions of sleep. Perhaps the greatest surprise from these initial studies is that the reduction in neurobehavioural performance resulting from sleep loss demonstrated in the laboratory is not an obligatory outcome of reduced sleep in the wild.},

  abstract = {Total sleep deprivation (TSD) of rats for 24 hours or less by continually enforced locomotion has consistently produced subsequent rebounds of slow-wave or high-amplitude EEG activity in NREM sleep, which has contributed to the widely held view that this EEG activity reflects particularly ``intense'' or restorative sleep. These rebounds usually have been accompanied by substantial rebounds of REM sleep. In contrast, chronic TSD (2 weeks or longer) by the disk-over-water (DOW) method has produced only huge, long-lasting rebounds of REM sleep with no rebound of high-amplitude NREM sleep. To evaluate whether the different rebounds result from different methods or from different lengths of deprivation, rats were subjected to 24-hour TSD by the DOW method. Rebounds included increases in high-amplitude and slow-wave activity; ie, the methods produced similar rebound patterns following short-term TSD. (Chronic TSD by continually enforced locomotion would be strategically difficult and severely confounded with motor fatigue.) Rats subjected to DOW-TSD for 4 days, well before the development of severe TSD symptoms, showed primarily REM sleep rebounds. Rats subjected to 1 day of selective REM sleep deprivation, but not their closely yoked control rats, showed large, significant REM sleep rebounds, which evidently were not induced by the stress of the deprivation method per se. The combined findings prompted reexamination of published evidence relevant to ``sleep intensity,'' including ``negative rebounds,'' rebounds in other species, the effects of stress and fatigue, depth of sleep indicators, and extended sleep. The review points out pitfalls in the designation of any specific pattern as intense sleep.},

The disk-over-water method permits chronic sleep deprivation of rats with gentle physical stimulation that can be equally applied to yoked control rats. A series of studies with this method has revealed little or no pathology in the control rats. The deprived rats show a reliable syndrome that includes temperature changes (which vary with the sleep stages that are lost); heat seeking behavior; increased food intake; weight loss; increased metabolic rate; increased plasma norepinephrine; decreased plasma thyroxine; an increased triiodothyronine-thyroxine ratio; and an increase of an enzyme which mediates thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue. The temperature changes are attributable to excessive heat loss and an elevated thermoregulatory setpoint, both of which increase thermoregulatory load, and the other changes are interpretable as responses to this increased load. This pattern indicates that sleep serves a thermoregulatory function in the rat. The sleep deprived rats also show stereotypic ulcerative and hyperkeratotic lesions localized to the tail and plantar surfaces of the paws, and they die within a matter of weeks; the mediation of these changes is unresolved. {\copyright} 1995.},

  abstract = {The increasing impacts of climate hazards combined with the loss of coastal habitats require urgent solutions to manage risk. Storm losses continue to grow and much of them are uninsured. These losses represent an increasing burden to individuals, businesses, and can jeopardize national development goals. Pre-hazard mitigation is cost effective, but both the public and private sector struggle to finance up-front investments in it. This article explores a resilience solution that combines risk transfer (e.g., insurance) with risk reduction (e.g., hazard mitigation), which have often been treated as two separate mechanisms for disaster risk management. The combined mechanism could help align environmental and risk management goals and create opportunities for public and private investment in nature-based projects. We assessed this resilience insurance with hypothetical cases for coral reef restoration. Under conservative assumptions, 44\% of the initial reef restoration costs would be covered just by insurance premium reductions in the first 5 years, with benefits amounting {$>$}6 times the total costs over 25 years. We also test the sensitivity to key factors such as project cost, risk reduction potential, insurance structure, economic exposure and discount rates. The resilience insurance mechanism is applicable to many coastlines and can help finance nature-based adaptation.},

Most studies have focused on studying parameters such as wave heights, but a systematic, global and long-term signal of climate change in global wave behavior remains undetermined. Here we show that the global wave power, which is the transport of the energy transferred from the wind into sea-surface motion, has increased globally (0.4\% per year) and by ocean basins since 1948. We also find long-term correlations and statistical dependency with sea surface temperatures, globally and by ocean sub-basins, particularly between the tropical Atlantic temperatures and the wave power in high south latitudes, the most energetic region globally. Results indicate the upper-ocean warming, a consequence of anthropogenic global warming, is changing the global wave climate, making waves stronger. This identifies wave power as a potentially valuable climate change indicator.},

We provide a fine-scale, national valuation of the flood risk reduction benefits of coral habitats to people, property, economies and infrastructure. Across 3,100\,km of US coastline, the top-most 1\,m of coral reefs prevents the 100-yr flood from growing by 23\% (113\,km2), avoiding flooding to 53,800 (62\%) people, US\$2.7\,billion (90\%) damage to buildings and US\$2.6\,billion (49\%) in indirect economic effects. We estimate the hazard risk reduction benefits of US coral reefs to exceed US\$1.8\,billion annually. Many highly developed coastlines in Florida and Hawaii receive annual benefits of over US\$10\,million\,km--1, whereas US reefs critically reduce flooding of vulnerable populations. This quantification of spatial risk reduction can help to prioritize joint actions in flood management and environmental conservation, opening new opportunities to support reef management with hazard mitigation funding.},

In spite of numerous differences, dogs' comparable sleep pattern, as well as several phenotypic similarities on both the behavioural and neural levels, make this species a most feasible model in many respects. Our aim was to investigate whether the so-called first-night effect, which in humans manifests as a marked macrostructure difference between the first and second sleep occasions, can be observed in family dogs. We used a non-invasive polysomnographic method to monitor and compare the characteristics of dogs' (N = 24) 3-hr-long afternoon naps on three occasions at the same location. We analysed how sleep macrostructure variables differed between the first, second and third occasions, considering also the effects of potential confounding variables such as the dogs' age and sleeping habits. Our findings indicate that first-night effect is present in dogs' sleep architecture, although its specifics somewhat deviate from the pattern observed in humans. Sleep macrostructure differences were mostly found between occasions 1 and 3; dogs slept more, had less wake after the first drowsiness episode, and reached drowsiness sleep earlier on occasion 3. Dogs, which had been reported to sleep rarely not at home, had an earlier non-rapid eye movement sleep, a shorter rapid eye movement sleep latency, and spent more time in rapid eye movement sleep on occasion 3, compared with occasion 1. Extending prior dog sleep data, these results help increase the validity of further sleep electroencephalography investigations in dogs.},

  abstract = {Understanding and sustainably managing complex environments such as marine ecosystems benefits from an integrated approach to ensure that information about all relevant components and their interactions at multiple and nested spatiotemporal scales are considered. This information is based on a wide range of ocean observations using different systems and approaches. An integrated approach thus requires effective collaboration between areas of expertise in order to improve coordination at each step of the ocean observing value chain, from the design and deployment of multi-platform observations to their analysis and the delivery of products, sometimes through data assimilation in numerical models. Despite significant advances over the last two decades in more cooperation across the ocean observing activities, this integrated approach has not yet been fully realized. The ocean observing system still suffers from organizational silos due to independent and often disconnected initiatives, the strong and sometimes destructive competition across disciplines and among scientists, and the absence of a well-established overall governance framework. Here, we address the need for enhanced organizational integration among all the actors of ocean observing, focusing on the occidental systems. We advocate for a major evolution in the way we collaborate, calling for transformative scientific, cultural, behavioral, and management changes. This is timely because we now have the scientific and technical capabilities as well as urgent societal and political drivers. The ambition of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021--2030) and the various efforts to grow a sustainable ocean economy and effective ocean protection efforts all require a more integrated approach to ocean observing. After analyzing the barriers that currently prevent this full integration within the occidental systems, we suggest nine approaches for breaking down the silos and promoting better coordination and sharing. These recommendations are related to the organizational framework, the ocean science culture, the system of recognition and rewards, the data management system, the ocean governance structure, and the ocean observing drivers and funding. These reflections are intended to provide food for thought for further dialogue between all parties involved and trigger concrete actions to foster a real transformational change in ocean observing.},

Maintaining a stable body temperature is a fundamental requirement for homeothermic animals, and water is a vital resource that facilitates thermoregulation through evaporative cooling, especially in hot environments. Here, we explore the potential for thermoregulatory costs to underlie the community collapse of birds in the Mojave Desert over the past century in response to climate change. The probability of persistence was lowest for species occupying the warmest and driest sites, which imposed the greatest cooling costs. We developed a general model of heat flux to evaluate whether water requirements for evaporative cooling contributed to species' declines by simulating thermoregulatory costs in the Mojave Desert for 50 bird species representing the range of observed declines. Bird species' declines were positively associated with climate-driven increases in water requirements for evaporative cooling and exacerbated by large body size, especially for species with animal-based diets. Species exhibiting reductions in body size across their range saved up to 14\% in cooling costs and experienced less decline than species without size reductions, suggesting total cooling costs as a mechanism underlying Bergmann's rule. Reductions in body size, however, are unlikely to offset the 50 to 78\% increase in cooling costs threatening desert birds from future climate change. As climate change spreads warm, dry conditions across the planet, water requirements are increasingly likely to drive population declines, providing a physiological basis for climate-driven extinctions.},

Understanding these processes is critical to reveal how conditions at sea cascade to population-level effects. To begin addressing these challenging questions, we collected diving, tracking, foraging success, and natality data for 297 adult female northern elephant seal migrations from 2004 to 2010. During the longer post-molting migration, individual energy gain rates were significant predictors of pregnancy. At sea, seals focused their foraging effort along a narrow band corresponding to the boundary between the sub-arctic and sub-tropical gyres. In contrast to shallow-diving predators, elephant seals target the gyre-gyre boundary throughout the year rather than follow the southward winter migration of surface features, such as the Transition Zone Chlorophyll Front. We also assessed the impact of added transit costs by studying seals at a colony near the southern extent of the species' range, 1,150 km to the south. A much larger proportion of seals foraged locally, implying plasticity in foraging strategies and possibly prey type. While these findings are derived from a single species, the results may provide insight to the foraging patterns of many other meso-pelagic predators in the northeast Pacific Ocean.},

For pelagic predators, behaviour-dependent foraging metrics are commonly used to identify important foraging areas, yet few of these metrics have been validated. Using the northern elephant seal as a model species, we validated the use of a behaviour-independent measure of foraging success (changes in drift rate) at the scale of the entire foraging migration, and then used this to assess a variety of common foraging metrics that are based on movement patterns and dive behaviour. Transit rate consistently provided the best estimate of daily foraging success, although the addition of other metrics provides insight into different foraging behaviours or strategies. While positive changes in buoyancy occurred throughout most of the migrations, implying successful feeding across much of the north Pacific, the areas of most rapid changes in buoyancy occurred along a latitudinal band (40-50{$^\circ$} N) corresponding to a dynamic hydrographic region including Subarctic Gyre and Transition Zone waters. These results support the use of transit rate as an index of foraging success: a metric that is easily derived from tracking measurements on a wide range of marine species. {\copyright} 2010 The Authors.

Using nearly 350,000 temperature and salinity profiles, we constructed an upper-ocean climatology and monthly anomaly fields for the 5-year era, 2004--2008. A basic description of the modern upper ocean based entirely on Argo data is presented here, to provide a baseline for comparison with past datasets and with ongoing Argo data, to test the adequacy of Argo sampling of large-scale variability, and to examine the consistency of the Argo dataset with related ocean observations from other programs. The Argo 5-year mean is compared to the World Ocean Atlas, highlighting the middle and high latitudes of the southern hemisphere as a region of strong multi-decadal warming and freshening. Moreover the region is one where Argo data have contributed an enormous increment to historical sampling, and where more Argo floats are needed for documenting large-scale variability. Globally, the Argo-era ocean is warmer than the historical climatology at nearly all depths, by an increasing amount toward the sea surface; it is saltier in the surface layer and fresher at intermediate levels. Annual cycles in temperature and salinity are compared, again to WOA01, and to the National Oceanography Center air--sea flux climatology, the Reynolds SST product, and AVISO satellite altimetric height. These products are consistent with Argo data on hemispheric and global scales, but show regional differences that may either point to systematic errors in the datasets or their syntheses, to physical processes, or to temporal variability. The present work is viewed as an initial step toward integrating Argo and other climate-relevant global ocean datasets.},

Artifacts, particularly certain types, may be more likely found in particular settings and stages of sleep. To overcome the limitation of regression methods in bidirectional contamination, a method based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) using time structure is applied. Artifact identification is based on time, frequency and scalp topography aspects of the independent components. Influence of artifacts is evaluated by calculating some target spectral variables before and after their reduction, using significance probability maps. Results show that ICA is a useful technique for the evaluation of these variables with clinical interest in different sleep stages.},

However, the impact of a project can be seriously reduced if the results are not communicated well. In this paper, we describe a means of managing and describing the outcomes of the Data Science projects in such a way that they optimally convey the insights gained. We focus on the main artifact of the non-verbal communication, namely project structure. In particular, we surveyed three sources of information on how to structure projects: common management methodologies, community best practices, and data sharing platforms. The survey resulted in a list of recommendations on how to build the project artifacts to make them clear, intuitive, and logical. We also provide hints on tools that can be helpful for managing such structures in an efficient manner. The paper is intended to motivate and support an informed decision on how to structure a Data Science project to facilitate better communication of the outcomes.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in ecology, biogeography and conservation biology to estimate relationships between environmental variables and species occurrence data and make predictions of how their distributions vary in space and time. During the past two decades, the field has increasingly made use of machine learning approaches for constructing and validating SDMs. Model accuracy has steadily increased as a result, but the interpretability of the fitted models, for example the relative importance of predictor variables or their causal effects on focal species, has not always kept pace. Here we draw attention to an emerging subdiscipline of artificial intelligence, explainable AI (xAI), as a toolbox for better interpreting SDMs. xAI aims at deciphering the behavior of complex statistical or machine learning models (e.g. neural networks, random forests, boosted regression trees), and can produce more transparent and understandable SDM predictions. We describe the rationale behind xAI and provide a list of tools that can be used to help ecological modelers better understand complex model behavior at different scales. As an example, we perform a reproducible SDM analysis in R on the African elephant and showcase some xAI tools such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) to help interpret local-scale behavior of the model. We conclude with what we see as the benefits and caveats of these techniques and advocate for their use to improve the interpretability of machine learning SDMs.},

Of the small gas molecules (NO, CO, H2S) that arise in human beings from endogenous enzymatic activities, the physiological significance ofNO is well established, whereas that ofCOorH2S remains controversial. Recent studies have explored the potential efficacy of inhalation therapies using these small gasmolecules in animal models of ALI.NOhas vasoregulatory and redox-active properties and can function as a selective pulmonary vasodilator. InhaledNO(iNO) has shown promise as a therapy in animalmodels of ALI including endotoxin challenge, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and lung transplantation. CO, another diatomic gas, can exert cellular tissue protection through antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative effects. CO has shown therapeutic potential in animal models of endotoxin challenge, oxidative lung injury, I/R injury, pulmonary fibrosis, ventilator-induced lung injury, and lung transplantation. H2S, a third potential therapeutic gas, can induce hypometabolic states in mice and can confer both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects in rodent models of ALI and sepsis. Clinical studies have shown variable results for the efficacy of iNO in lung transplantation and failure for this therapy to improve mortality in ARDS patients. No clinical studies have been conducted with H2S. The clinical efficacy of CO remains unclear and awaits further controlled clinical studies in transplantation and sepsis.},

The goal of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of a `digital workshop', combining the interactive CommunityViz tool with the immersive lab facilities at the Collaborative for Advanced Landscape Planning (CALP). In support of the larger community planning process, two 3-h workshops were held at CALP's Landscape Immersion Lab. To facilitate collaborative exploration, the interactive landscape visualisation and real-time data analysis capabilities of CommunityViz were employed to illustrate the possible outcomes of residential density policies for Bowen Island's Snug Cove community. The community planning workshops were structured to provide the 14 semi-expert participants with the opportunity to explore and discuss the contentious residential density components of the draft Snug Cove Village Plan. The abilities to dynamically explore the visualisations of the planning proposals, and to see real-time changes in indicator metrics were considered particularly informative, and appeared to increase participants' understanding of the plan. Written and verbal responses indicated, however, that there was insufficient time to examine and interact with the information during the workshop, suggesting a need to examine in greater depth how and when these tools might best be employed in collaborative settings. Current and future research relating to this project is discussed.},

At the same time, emerging technologies, such as mobile devices, social media platforms, and artificial intelligence, give rise to a series of challenges and limitations. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the broad range of technologies that are increasingly used for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data on ES, including Earth observation, mobile technologies, data science, modeling/simulation, immersive technologies, visualization, and web-based tools. To identify current opportunities and challenges, we systematically reviewed the literature on ES of the last 10~years (2012--2022). We first describe the state-of-the-art of emerging technologies, synthesizing their applicability, opportunities, and limitations. Then, we discuss open issues, future research needs, and potential for further applications in ES research. Our findings indicate great opportunities to increase knowledge on ES thanks to low costs, high data availability, and high flexibility of the technologies. We also find a strong potential to support decision-making, learning and communication. However, limitations and challenges related to the accuracy of the variables and models, accessibility to data, technologies, and information as well as ethical concerns need to be addressed by the research community to assure an inclusive and meaningful use of the technologies. Our findings also suggest that further insights into ES may be achieved through a better integration of different technologies in the future, e.g., Earth observation, data science, and web-based platforms, a stronger transdisciplinary collaboration to advance knowledge on ES, and by broadening the perspective to technological developments in other related fields of research.},

This model proposes that all species of the animal kingdom share a universal sleep function that shunts waking energy utilization toward sleep-dependent biological investment. For endotherms, REM sleep evolved to enhance energy appropriation for somatic and CNS-related processes by eliminating thermoregulatory defenses and skeletal muscle tone. Alternating REM with NREM sleep conserves energy by decreasing the need for core body temperature defense. Three EA phenotypes are proposed: sleep-wake cycling, torpor, and continuous (or predominant) wakefulness. Each phenotype carries inherent costs and benefits. Sleep-wake cycling downregulates specific biological processes in waking and upregulates them in sleep, thereby decreasing energy demands imposed by wakefulness, reducing cellular infrastructure requirements, and resulting in overall energy conservation. Torpor achieves the greatest energy savings, but critical biological operations are compromised. Continuous wakefulness maximizes niche exploitation, but endures the greatest energy demands. The EA model advances a new construct for understanding sleep-wake organization in ontogenetic and phylogenetic domains.},

While previous studies indicated a decrease in cognitive performance in an under water setting, they have only provided behavioural data. This study aimed to review whether recording of electro cortical activity by the use of electroencephalography (EEG) is possible in an under water setting and if so, to identify the influence of water immersion at a depth of 4~m on neurocognitive markers. Ten male subjects performed a cognitive choice-reaction times (RT) task that progressed through five levels of increasing difficulty on land and when submerged 4~m under water. N200 latency and amplitude in the occipital and frontal areas were measured, and baseline cortical activity was measured during rest in both conditions. Neither RT nor amplitude or latency of the N200 showed any significant changes between the land and the under water conditions. Also theta, alpha and beta frequencies showed no differences between the two conditions. The data provided in this study demonstrate the possibility of recording EEG even under the extreme conditions of full body water immersion. The lack of cognitive impairment in RT and N200 in the under water condition may be explained by the fact that only experienced divers participated in the study. As a proof of principle, this study generates many new experimental possibilities that will improve our understanding of cognitive processes under water.},

We used 12 pinniped life-history and ecological traits to test hypotheses concerning the influence of phylogeny, maternal body size, breeding substrate, and other factors on the evolution of lactation strategies. We used independent contrasts to account for phylogenetic effects on correlations between traits. Our findings indicate that the negative relationships between maternal mass and lactation length and between maternal mass and the percentage of time spent at sea by females during lactation are not recent adaptations, but likely a result of phylogenetic history and an evolutionary grade shift in lactation length, which occurred when the phocids diverged from the otariids. Differences in body size between the ancestral phocid and otariid impacted their foraging strategies and metabolic rates, which subsequently influenced lactation strategies. The fat-storage abilities of large phocids may have allowed them to exploit remote and patchy prey resources and thereby reduce time spent feeding during lactation. We also suggest that an early divergence in the mammary gland structure of phocids and otariids is a fundamental influence on pinniped lactation strategies. Although estimates are lacking for several key species, body size appears to have little adaptive influence on the lactation length of extant species. Instead, an abbreviated lactation period seems to be adaptive in minimizing the relative milk energy expended over lactation, although it may have initially evolved to reduce maternal overhead, especially in ancestral fasting phocids. Subsequently, a brief lactation in phocids was also selected through the effects of terrestrial predation, the instability of breeding on pack-ice, and the energy benefits of increasing milk energy output.},

Ecological models could contribute to such predictions, but in the past this was often not the case.

In this synthesis paper, we discuss how to strengthen the role of ecological modeling in supporting environmental management decisions with a focus on methodological aspects. We address mainly ecological modellers but also potential users of modeling results. Various modeling approaches can be used to predict the response of ecosystems to anthropogenic interventions, including mechanistic models, statistical models, and machine learning approaches. Regardless of the chosen approach, we outline how to better align the modeling to the decision making process, and identify six requirements that we believe are important to increase the usefulness of ecological models for management support, especially if management decisions need to be justified to the public. These cover: (i) a mechanistic understanding regarding causality, (ii) alignment of model input and output with the management decision, (iii) appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions, (iv) uncertainty quantification, (v) sufficient predictive performance, and (vi) transparent communication. We discuss challenges and synthesize suggestions for addressing these points.},

  abstract = {Climate change and the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are simultaneously reshaping environmental conservation. This article reviews the intersection of these two trends. First, we review how AI has become integrated into existing climate knowledge infrastructures and decision-making systems. Second, we review how AI is reshaping decision-making processes in the face of climate change, focusing on the governance of changing biological systems. AI is transforming data collection and classification, conservation decision-making, and rule enforcement. A crucial theme is the changing temporality of environmental governance. We emphasize automated data collection and classification, dynamic optimization and predictive enforcement. Third, we turn to emergent problems in the ethics and politics of algorithmic conservation. AI's increasingly prevalent role in conservation has the potential to introduce ethical dilemmas, redistribute power among stakeholders, and enable the emergence of new objects of knowledge and political struggles.},

The new findings, published April 20 in the journal Science, show that while elephant seals may spend 10 hours a day sleeping on the beach during the breeding season, they average just 2 hours of sleep per day when they are at sea on months-long foraging trips. They sleep for about 10 minutes at a time during deep, 30-minute dives, often spiraling downward while fast asleep, and sometimes lying motionless on the seafloor.

  abstract = {In order to specify the resting behaviors in captive bottlenose dolphin, we quantitatively analyzed behavior of 16 dolphins in three aquariums in Japan. We observed their behaviors in the low-activity time (0 a.m. -- 3 a.m.), assuming that the resting behaviors would be most prominent and abundant at this time. We analyzed these behaviors based on the data of their diurnal activity rhythm that we have clarified by measuring swimming speed and breath frequency. The behavior patterns characteristic to the low-activity time could be categorized into the following three types: ``bottom-rest'' characterized by long immobile stay on the tank bottom, ``surface-rest'' characterized by long immobile stay at the water surface, and ``swim-rest'' characterized by slow circle-swim near the bottom along a fixed trajectory. During these behaviors, breath frequency was significantly lower than the daily mean and at least one eye tended to be closed. These three behaviors accounted for 86.6\% of the total observation time in the low-activity time. The resting behaviors were often observed even in the high-activity time (0 p.m. -- 4 p.m.); these three behaviors accounted for 38.5\% of the total observation time in the high-activity time. In swim-rest, frequency of sound emission was significantly lower than that of other behaviors with high-speed swimming, and both eyes or one eye, especially the eye facing the inner side of the swimming circle tended to be closed. The eye condition and the periodical change of circle-swim direction or position-exchange observed during swim-rest suggest a relation between this behavior and unihemispheric sleep. The change in the resting behavior observed in the dolphins under nervous situations suggests that the dolphins flexibly change the type and the quantity of the resting behaviors according to the situation.},

Monitoring these ecosystem-level changes often requires labor-intensive surveys that are unable to detect rapid or unanticipated environmental changes. Here we have developed a generalizable, data-driven solution to this challenge using eco-acoustic data. We exploited a convolutional neural network to embed soundscapes from a variety of ecosystems into a common acoustic space. In both supervised and unsupervised modes, this allowed us to accurately quantify variation in habitat quality across space and in biodiversity through time. On the scale of seconds, we learned a typical soundscape model that allowed automatic identification of anomalous sounds in playback experiments, providing a potential route for real-time automated detection of irregular environmental behavior including illegal logging and hunting. Our highly generalizable approach, and the common set of features, will enable scientists to unlock previously hidden insights from acoustic data and offers promise as a backbone technology for global collaborative autonomous ecosystem monitoring efforts.},

  abstract = {Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24\,h, short-term ({\textasciitilde}5\,min), and ultra-short-term ({$<$}5\,min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from {\textasciitilde}2\,min to 24\,h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24\,h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.},

Visual observation supplement electrophysiological studies and allow obtaining novel data about sleep of cetaceans. In the present study we examined behavior of 3 adult Commerson's dolphins Cephalorhynchus commersonii kept in the oceanarium Sea World (San Di ego, CA, USA). The behavior of the dolphins can be subdivided into 5 swimming types: (1) active swimming marked by variable and irregular trajectory of movement (for 3 dolphins, on average, 35.1 {\textpm} 2.7\% of the 24 h period) was the active wakefulness; (2) circular swimming was divided into the slow and fast swimming and occupied, on average, 44.4 {\textpm} 3.8 and 9.7 {\textpm} 0.8\% of the 24 h period, respectively; during the circular swimming, dolphins performed from 1 to 6 circular swimming dur ing one respiration pause; (3) quiet chaotic swimming (3.9 {\textpm} 1.2\%) that occurred at the bottom and was not accompanied by signs of activity; (4) hanging, and (5) slow swimming at the surface (4.1 {\textpm} 0.5 and 2.8 {\textpm} 0.4\%) respectively; the latter two swimming types were accompanied by frequent respiration (hyperventilation). We suggest that the sleep state in Commerson's dolphins occurs pre dominantly during the circular and quiet swimming. From time to time the dolphins decreased the speed, up to complete stop. Such episodes appeared to be the deepest sleep episodes. In all dol phins, muscle jerks as well erection in male are observed. Most jerks and erections occurred during the circular and quiet chaotic swimming. Thus, Commerson's dolphins, like other studied small cetaceans, are swimming for 24 h per day and they sleep during the swimming. Some muscle jerks that were observed in the dolphins in this study might have been brief episodes of paradoxical sleep.

Rats die from one form of sleep deprivation, but sleep loss has not been shown to cause death in well-controlled studies in other vertebrate species. Some marine mammal species do not show evidence for REM sleep, and convincing evidence for this state in reptiles, fish and insects is lacking. The enormous variation in the nature of rest and sleep states across the animal kingdom and within the mammalian class has important implications for understanding the evolution and functions of sleep.},

Theories of REM sleep have suggested a role for this state in periodic brain activation during sleep, in localized recuperative processes and in emotional regulation. Across mammals, the amount and nature of sleep are correlated with age, body size and ecological variables, such as whether the animals live in a terrestrial or an aquatic environment, their diet and the safety of their sleeping site. Sleep may be an efficient time for the completion of a number of functions, but variations in sleep expression indicate that these functions may differ across species.},

The platypus also had rapid eye movement sleep as defined by atonia with rapid eye movements, twitching and the electrocardiogram pattern of rapid eye movement. However, this state occurred while the electroencephalogram was moderate or high in voltage, as in non-rapid eye movement sleep in adult and marsupial mammals. This suggests that the low-voltage electroencephalogram is a more recently evolved feature of mammalian rapid eye movement sleep. Rapid eye movement sleep occupied 5.8--8 h/day in the platypus, more than in any other animal.},

Broadly speaking, EEG is most important in patients with impaired consciousness or altered mental state (table 1):  View this table:  Table 1   {$\quad$}Strengths and weaknesses of the EEG EEG changes in encephalopathies are similar, whether the cause is septic, metabolic, toxic, or structural.

In mild encephalopathic states, slowing of normal alpha ({$\alpha$}) rhythms occurs, and with more severe encephalopathy, the appearance of theta ({\texttheta}) and continuous or non-continuous delta ({$\delta$}) activities. A variety of additional EEG patterns can be seen, such as frontal intermittent rhythmic delta (FIRDA), periodic lateralised or bilateral epileptiform discharges (PEDs, BIPEDs), and triphasic waves. None of these patterns is specific to a particular pathophysiological process or diagnosis, but PEDs are most likely to occur in acute or subacute focal destructive pathologies or focal epileptogenic lesions; triphasic waves are typically found in metabolic encephalopathies; and some patients with mesial fronto-parietal lesions or third ventricle tumours show FIRDA in their EEG. \#\#\# Metabolic encephalopathies A patient with acute change in awareness whose EEG shows triphasic waves and diffuse slow activity will usually have a metabolic encephalopathy.

These PSWs, which manifest as increases in PS over normal levels, appear to exhibit shorter latencies to onset when the amount of material presented during acquisition is increased. Prevention of the PSW results in memory deficits. In humans, there is now evidence that different types of tasks are differentially sensitive to rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (REMD). Memory for declarative or explicit types of tasks appear not to be affected by REM sleep loss, while memory for cognitive procedural or implicit types of material are impaired by REMD. Using post training auditory stimulation during REM sleep, memory enhancement of the procedural material is also possible. The memory for a fine motor task appears to be sensitive to post training stage 2 sleep loss. The important neural structures are generally not yet identifiable, although the hippocampus would appear to be important for place learning in the Morris water maze.},

The goal of the present study is to examine the effect of sampling density and coverage on the ability to accurately localize sources, using common linear inverse weight techniques, at different depths. Several inverse methods are examined, using the popular head conductivity. New method Simulation studies were employed to examine the effect of spatial sampling of the potential field at the head surface, in terms of sensor density and coverage of the inferior and superior head regions. In addition, the effects of sensor density and coverage are investigated in the source localization of epileptiform EEG. Results Greater sensor density improves source localization accuracy. Moreover, across all sampling density and inverse methods, adding samples on the inferior surface improves the accuracy of source estimates at all depths. Comparison with existing methods More accurate source localization of EEG data can be achieved with high spatial sampling of the head surface electrodes. Conclusions The most accurate source localization is obtained when the voltage surface is densely sampled over both the superior and inferior surfaces.},

  abstract = {Many aspects of morphology of benthic algae (length, surface area-to-volume ratio, and blade undulation) are plastic traits that vary in response to physical factors (such as light or water flow environment). This study examines whether frond buoyancy is a plastic trait, and whether differences in morphology including buoyancy affect the potential persistence of macroalgae in habitats characterized by different water flow regimes. Fronds of the tropical alga Turbinaria ornata in protected backreef environments in Moorea, French Polynesia possess pneumatocysts (gas-filled floats) and experience positive buoyant forces, whereas fronds in wave-exposed forereef sites either lack pneumatocysts entirely or have very small, rudimentary pneumatocysts and experience negative buoyant forces. Forereef fronds transplanted to the backreef developed pneumatocysts and experienced increased buoyant force indicating that buoyancy is a phenotypically plastic trait in T. ornata. In comparing the potential for dislodgement by drag, drag was greater on forereef fronds at low flow speeds as these fronds were stiffer and did not bend over at low flow speeds and therefore were less streamlined in the flow than backreef algae, which bent easily. The environmental stress factor (ESF) (a measure of the likelihood of detachment for a frond in its habitat) was higher for forereef than backreef fronds at all flow speeds. When examined with respect to the flow velocities likely in their respective habitats however, the chance of detachment for backreef and forereef was similar. Neither backreef nor forereef fronds were predicted to break under normal, non-storm conditions, but both were predicted to break in storms. Strong forereef morphologies are well suited to habitats characterized by rapid flow, whereas the weaker, buoyant, tall backreef fronds are well suited to habitats where crowding and shading is common but hydrodynamic forces are low.},

  abstract = {Turbinaria ornata (Turner) J. Agardh is a tropical alga that disperses by detached, reproductively mature floating fronds. Material properties (breaking stress, breaking extension), buoyancy, and the proportion of reproductive tissue per frond were measured for juvenile, adult, and old fronds of T. ornata. Correlations between these factors indicate that as fronds age and become more reproductively mature, the tissue in their stipes (where they break) becomes weaker, more brittle, and the overall buoyancy of the frond increases. Measurement of drag force experienced by fronds from each ontogenetic stage allowed calculation of the environmental stress factor (ESF), which indicates the likelihood of detachment of a frond in the flow environment of its habitat. The ESF for fronds of each ontogenetic stage predicted that reproductively mature fronds (adult and old) break more readily than immature (juvenile) fronds. Increased proportions of reproductively mature fronds in floating rafts following storms compared with the proportion of mature fronds attached to the substratum support the ESF predictions. This combination of ontogenetic changes in material properties, buoyancy, and reproductive maturity in combination with the life history of T. ornata may contribute to the dispersal of this alga throughout French Polynesia.},

  abstract = {Like many reefs worldwide, reefs in French Polynesia are experiencing a shift from coral-dominated to algal-dominated systems. The macroalga Turbinaria ornata comprises the majority of the increasing algal biomass on the barrier reefs surrounding these islands, and its distribution is increasing throughout this region. Aspects of the ecomorphology of Turbinaria make it ideally suited to thrive under the physical conditions found across barrier reefs throughout French Polynesia. Spatial morphological variation allows Turbinaria to produce morphotypes that are suited either to the calm, unidirectional, slowly flowing water in the backreef or to the high-energy wave-driven flow of the forereef. Backreef plants are flexible and produce airbladders that make them buoyant, whereas forereef plants are not buoyant, but strong and stiff. Production of bladders and resulting buoyancy has been found to be a phenotypically plastic trait in response to movement of water and confers advantages to backreef plants and plays an important role in dispersal. Ontogenetic variation of buoyancy, material properties, and reproductive capacity is part of a dispersal strategy whereby fertile, buoyant fronds drift between oceanic islands and form new populations, thereby contributing to the recent expansion of range of T. ornata across French Polynesia.

Moruroan and Tahitian populations have maximal density and maximal reproductive characteristics during the cool and hot seasons, respectively. Recruits are present throughout the year at all sites. Within the reference field site, individuals were initially distributed regularly and then became clumped through time, recruits appeared around adults. Recruits mortality followed a similar pattern, whereas mortality of adults and juveniles was even throughout the monitoring period. Populations initially had similar proportions of recruits, juveniles and adults (28, 40 and 32\%, respectively), but at the end, recruits represent 92\% of the population. A linear relationship between the number of individuals present within the station and the colonized substrate area was determined (R2 = 0.96), suggesting a limiting effect of the substrate against the settlement of T. ornata with time. Moreover, the growth of recruits in the close vicinity of adults was arrested in the young populations: recruitment may therefore, significantly buffer high rates of adult mortality. It may contribute to the invasion and, more interesting to the persistence of T. ornata in new colonized area. (copyright) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Data dealing with density, maturity, size structure of the mature population, sex-distribution and fertility were collected over 16 months between November 1994 and February 1996. Turbinaria ornata and Sargassum mangarevense populations settle on the reef throughout the year with a peak in density during the cool season. A density gradient from the fringing reef to the outer biogenic ridge was evident. A peak in maturity and fertility was observed during the warm season. A dwarfism of thallus length was noticed in Turbinaria ornata on the outer biogenic ridge whereas it was not observed in Sargassum mangarevense. The populations of both species settled on the fringing reef and outer biogenic ridge, two physically and chemically unstable areas, exhibited a high sexual reproduction, whereas it was lower on the inner barrier reef. Whatever the area considered the period of reproduction of these two species extended throughout the whole year. The data collected during this study were used to explain the colonization of different habitats by these two species.},

  abstract = {Citizen-science projects engage volunteers to gather or process data to address scientific questions. But citizen-science projects vary in their ability to contribute usefully for science, conservation, or public policy. eBird has evolved from a basic citizen-science project into a collective enterprise, taking a novel approach to citizen science by developing cooperative partnerships among experts in a wide range of fields: population and distributions, conservation biologists, quantitative ecologists, statisticians, computer scientists, GIS and informatics specialists, application developers, and data administrators. The goal is to increase data quantity through participant recruitment and engagement, but also to quantify and control for data quality issues such as observer variability, imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data collection. Advances at the interface among ecology, statistics, and computer science allow us to create new species distribution models that provide accurate estimates across broad spatial and temporal scales with extremely detailed resolution. eBird data are openly available and used by a broad spectrum of students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government agencies, land managers, and policy makers. Feedback from this broad data use community helps identify development priorities. As a result, eBird has become a major source of biodiversity data, increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of species distributions, and having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their habitats.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the creation of parametric surrogate models for applications in science and engineering where the goal is to predict high-dimensional output quantities of interest, such as pressure, temperature and strain fields. The proposed methodology develops a low-dimensional parametrization of these quantities of interest using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and combines this parametrization with machine learning methods to learn the map between the input parameters and the POD expansion coefficients. The use of particular solutions in the POD expansion provides a way to embed physical constraints, such as boundary conditions and other features of the solution that must be preserved. The relative costs and effectiveness of four different machine learning techniques---neural networks, multivariate polynomial regression, k-nearest-neighbors and decision trees---are explored through two engineering examples. The first example considers prediction of the pressure field around an airfoil, while the second considers prediction of the strain field over a damaged composite panel. The case studies demonstrate the importance of embedding physical constraints within learned models, and also highlight the important point that the amount of model training data available in an engineering setting is often much less than it is in other machine learning applications, making it essential to incorporate knowledge from physical models.},

Here, we show that the FNE is a manifestation of one hemisphere being more vigilant than the other as a night watch to monitor unfamiliar surroundings during sleep [5, 6]. Using advanced neuroimaging techniques [7, 8] as well as polysomnography, we found that the temporary sleep disturbance in the first sleep experimental session involves regional interhemispheric asymmetry of sleep depth [9]. The interhemispheric asymmetry of sleep depth associated with the FNE was found in the default-mode network (DMN) involved with spontaneous internal thoughts during wakeful rest [10, 11]. The degree of asymmetry was significantly correlated with the sleep-onset latency, which reflects the degree of difficulty of falling asleep and is a critical measure for the FNE. Furthermore, the hemisphere with reduced sleep depth showed enhanced evoked brain response to deviant external stimuli. Deviant external stimuli detected by the less-sleeping hemisphere caused more arousals and faster behavioral responses than those detected by the other hemisphere. None of these asymmetries were evident during subsequent sleep sessions. These lines of evidence are in accord with the hypothesis that troubled sleep in an unfamiliar environment is an act for survival over an unfamiliar and potentially dangerous environment by keeping one hemisphere partially more vigilant than the other hemisphere as a night watch, which wakes the sleeper up when unfamiliar external signals are detected.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of our research is to understand the role of sleep and sleep disruption in the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). BACKGROUND: PTSD is a severe debilitating disorder with profound socio-economic costs. Hyperarousal, nightmares and sleep disruptions are considered to be the hallmark of PTSD. However, their role in the development of PTSD is unclear. To better understand this, we used the most widely-used and ecologically valid ``predator odor trauma'' model to mimic human PTSD. DESIGN/METHODS: C57BL/6J mice, implanted with electrodes in the hippocampus and muscles to examine sleep-wakefulness and hippocampal field potentials, were used in a set of experiments as described: Experiment 1: The experiment was initiated by replacing the animal's recording cages with contextual cages (aluminum foil wrapped on the bottom and outside half of recording cages) followed by exposure to predator odor (soiled cat litter) 30 minutes later. After 90 minutes of exposure to predator odor, mice were transferred back to their respective recording cages and left undisturbed for 5 days. On Day 5, animals were exposed to objective reminders (contextual cages) for three hours. Sleep-wakefulness and hippocampal field potentials were continuously recorded for all 5 days. Control animals underwent the same protocol except that they were exposed to clean litter. Experiment 2: Same as experiment 1 except that sleep was disrupted (by gentle auditory tactile and stimuli) for three hours immediately after the trauma. RESULTS: Mice exposed to predator odor trauma displayed hyperarousal and sleep disruptions. Exposure to objective reminders resulted in ``flashbacks'' or replication of behaviors observed during original trauma. Three hours of sleep disruption reduced PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest 1) mice exposed to predator odor trauma mimic sleep disruptions observed in human PTSD. 2) If sleep is disturbed immediately after trauma, PTSD symptoms are attenuated.

  abstract = {Biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, impacting ecosystem services necessary to ensure food, water, and human health and well-being. Understanding the distribution of species and their habitats is crucial for conservation policy planning. However, traditional methods in ecology for species distribution models (SDMs) generally focus either on narrow sets of species or narrow geographical areas and there remain significant knowledge gaps about the distribution of species. A major reason for this is the limited availability of data traditionally used, due to the prohibitive amount of effort and expertise required for traditional field monitoring. The wide availability of remote sensing data and the growing adoption of citizen science tools to collect species observations data at low cost offer an opportunity for improving biodiversity monitoring and enabling the modelling of complex ecosystems. We introduce a novel task for mapping bird species to their habitats by predicting species encounter rates from satellite images, and present SatBird, a satellite dataset of locations in the USA with labels derived from presence-absence observation data from the citizen science database eBird, considering summer (breeding) and winter seasons. We also provide a dataset in Kenya representing low-data regimes. We additionally provide environmental data and species range maps for each location. We benchmark a set of baselines on our dataset, including SOTA models for remote sensing tasks. SatBird opens up possibilities for scalably modelling properties of ecosystems worldwide.},

Sleep in animals is often estimated by behavioural observations, or recorded on restrained animals with invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) techniques, which might affect sleep patterns. Earlier studies on sleep in cows showed that they sleep about 4. h per day and drowse almost twice the time. The aim of this study was to record and differentiate between vigilance states in dairy cows using a non-invasive EEG method.Brain activity (electroencephalography, EEG), eye movements (electrooculography, EOG) and muscle activity (electromyography, EMG) were recorded for 6. h per animal using surface-attached electrodes to measure different vigilance states. Behaviour registrations from direct observations were combined with the EEG data in order to confirm the identification of different vigilance states from the EEG, EOG and EMG recordings. 8 dry dairy cows, lactation number 1-8 and age 3-11 years, of the Swedish Red breed from the research herd at Kungs{\"a}ngen Research Centre, Uppsala, Sweden, were used in the study.The EEG recordings showed that non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep displayed low frequency waves, sometimes with slow wave activity. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and alert wakefulness shared similar features of desynchronised waves with varying frequency and could be differentiated by reduced neck muscle activity during REM sleep.The main conclusion from this study is that it is possible to distinguish different vigilance states in dairy cows using surface-attached EEG electrodes. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Heart rate, swimming speed and diving depth data were collected from free-ranging grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, as they foraged and travelled in the sea around the Hebrides Islands off western Scotland. Information was collected on a tracking yacht using a combination of sonic and radio telemetry. Diving heart rate declined as a function of dive duration. In long dives, grey seals employed extreme bradycardia, with heart rates falling to 4beatsminϪ1 for extended periods, despite the animal being free to breathe at will. This extreme dive response is part of the normal foraging behaviour. Seals spent 89\% of the time submerged during bouts of long dives; swimming was restricted to ascent and descent. Dive durations exceeded estimated aerobic dive limit, even assuming resting metabolic rates. These results indicate that behavioural, and possibly cellular, energy-sparing mechanisms play an important role in diving behaviour of grey seals. This has implications not only for studies of mammalian energetics but also for our understanding of the foraging tactics and prey selection of marine mammals. If some seals are using energy-sparing mechanisms to reduce metabolic costs while at depth, they may be forced to wait for and ambush prey rather than to search for and chase it.},

  abstract = {The functions of slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, distinct sleep substates present in both mammals and birds, remain unresolved. One approach to gaining insight into their function is to trace the evolution of these states through examining sleep in as many taxonomic groups as possible. The mammalian and avian clades are each composed of two extant groups, i.e., the monotremes (echidna and platypus) and therian (marsupial and eutherian [or placental]) mammals, and Palaeognaths (cassowaries, emus, kiwi, ostriches, rheas, and tinamous) and Neognaths (all other birds) among birds. Previous electrophysiological studies of monotremes and ostriches have identified a unique ``mixed'' sleep state combining features of SWS and REM sleep unlike the well-delineated sleep states observed in all therian mammals and Neognath birds. In the platypus this state is characterized by periods of REM sleep-related myoclonic twitching, relaxed skeletal musculature, and rapid eye movements, occurring in conjunction with SWS-related slow waves in the forebrain electroencephalogram (EEG). A similar mixed state was also observed in ostriches; although in addition to occurring during periods with EEG slow waves, reduced muscle tone and rapid eye movements also occurred in conjunction with EEG activation, a pattern typical of REM sleep in Neognath birds. Collectively, these studies suggested that REM sleep occurring exclusively as an integrated state with forebrain activation might have evolved independently in the therian and Neognath lineages. To test this hypothesis, we examined sleep in the elegant crested tinamou (Eudromia elegans), a small Palaeognath bird that more closely resembles Neognath birds in size and their ability to fly. A 24-h period was scored for sleep state based on electrophysiology and behavior. Unlike ostriches, but like all of the Neognath birds examined, all indicators of REM sleep usually occurred in conjunction with forebrain activation in tinamous. The absence of a mixed REM sleep state in tinamous calls into question the idea that this state is primitive among Palaeognath birds and therefore birds in general.},

  abstract = {1. Linking key ecological characteristics with animal behaviour is essential for identifying and protecting important habitats that support life functions. Spinner dolphins display a predictable diurnal behavioural pattern where they forage offshore at night and return to sheltered bays during daytime to rest. These bays, which are also subject to considerable use by humans, have long been recognized as key habitats for this species although the extent to which dolphins rely on specific characteristics of these habitats for rest has not been quantified. 2. An integration of boat-based and land-based group focal follow sampling regimes and three gradient boosting generalized additive models were developed to identify habitat fea-tures that contribute to the occurrence of resting spinner dolphins in coastal waters off Hawai'i Island. Two `in-bay' models used data collected within bays, and a third `coastal' model (near-shore, outside of bays) used data collected both inside and outside of bays. 3. The coastal model identified that spinner dolphins were unlikely to rest outside sheltered bays. In-bay models showed that dolphins rested throughout daylight hours within bays with a peak resting period between 10.00 h to 14.00 h. The models also identified bottom-sub-strate-type as an important predictor of rest. Pseudo R2 values of 0?61 and 0?70 for the in- bay models and 0?66 for the coastal model showed that these models provided a good fit to strate-type as an important predictor of rest. Pseudo R2 values of 0?61 and 0?70 for the in- bay models and 0?66 for the coastal model showed that these models provided a good fit to the behavioural data for the occurrence of resting spinner dolphins. bay models and 0?66 for the coastal model showed that these models provided a good fit to the behavioural data for the occurrence of resting spinner dolphins. 4. Synthesis and application. To date, studies evaluating spinner dolphin resting habitat have focussed on areas inside bays only. Here, we combined data collected inside and outside bays, and illustrate that should resting spinner dolphins be displaced from resting bays, they are unlikely to engage in resting behaviour elsewhere. Results provide further information on the importance of bays as important habitat for resting spinner dolphins. To mitigate the distur-bance from human interactions during important rest periods, we recommend that manage-ment keep the spinner dolphin resting areas free from human activities. Our quantitative approach where models explicitly link behaviour with habitat characteristics is applicable to identify important habitats for protection of other taxa.},

  abstract = {Most of our knowledge about the regulation and function of sleep is based on studies in a restricted number of mammalian species, particularly nocturnal rodents. Hence, there is still much to learn from comparative studies in other species.

  abstract = {Sleep is a behavioral and physiological state that is thought to serve important functions. Many animals go through phases in the annual cycle where sleep time might be limited, for example, during the migration and breeding phases. This leads to the question whether there are seasonal changes in sleep homeostasis. Using electroencephalogram (EEG) data loggers, we measured sleep in summer and winter in 13 barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) under semi-natural conditions. During both seasons, we examined the homeostatic regulation of sleep by depriving the birds of sleep for 4 and 8 h after sunset. In winter, barnacle geese showed a clear diurnal rhythm in sleep and wakefulness. In summer, this rhythm was less pronounced, with sleep being spread out over the 24-h cycle. On average, the geese slept 1.5 h less per day in summer compared with winter. In both seasons, the amount of NREM sleep was additionally affected by the lunar cycle, with 2 h NREM sleep less during full moon compared to new moon. During summer, the geese responded to 4 and 8 h of sleep deprivation with a compensatory increase in NREM sleep time. In winter, this homeostatic response was absent. Overall, sleep deprivation only resulted in minor changes in the spectral composition of the sleep EEG. In conclusion, barnacle geese display season-dependent homeostatic regulation of sleep. These results demonstrate that sleep homeostasis is not a rigid phenomenon and suggest that some species may tolerate sleep loss under certain conditions or during certain periods of the year.},

It is often assumed that REM sleep is a homeostatically regulated process and that a need for REM sleep builds up, either during prior wakefulness or during preceding slow wave sleep. In the current study, we tested this hypothesis in six diurnal tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri), small mammals closely related to primates. All animals were individually housed and kept under a 12:12 light-dark cycle with an ambient temperature of 24 {$^\circ$}C. We recorded sleep and temperature in the tree shrews for 3 consecutive 24 h days. During the second night, we exposed the animals to a low ambient temperature of 4 {$^\circ$}C, a procedure that is known to suppress REM sleep. Cold exposure caused a significant drop in brain temperature and body temperature and also resulted in a strong and selective suppression of REM sleep by 64.9\%. However, contrary to our expectation, the loss of REM sleep was not recovered during the subsequent day and night. These findings in a diurnal mammal confirm that the expression of REM sleep is highly sensitive to environmental temperature but do not support the view that REM sleep is homeostatically regulated in this species.},

We developed a novel method of assessing sleep duration using data from 4,094 Whitehall II Study (United Kingdom, 2012-2013) participants aged 60-83 who wore the accelerometer for 9 consecutive days, filled in a sleep log and reported sleep duration via questionnaire. Our sleep detection algorithm defined (nocturnal) sleep as a period of sustained inactivity, itself detected as the absence of change in arm angle greater than 5 degrees for 5 minutes or more, during a period recorded as sleep by the participant in their sleep log. The resulting estimate of sleep duration had a moderate (but similar to previous findings) agreement with questionnaire based measures for time in bed, defined as the difference between sleep onset and waking time (kappa = 0.32, 95\%CI:0.29,0.34) and total sleep duration (kappa = 0.39, 0.36,0.42). This estimate was lower for time in bed for women, depressed participants, those reporting more insomnia symptoms, and on weekend days. No such group differences were found for total sleep duration. Our algorithm was validated against data from a polysomnography study on 28 persons which found a longer time window and lower angle threshold to have better sensitivity to wakefulness, while the reverse was true for sensitivity to sleep. The novelty of our method is the use of a generic algorithm that will allow comparison between studies rather than a "count" based, device specific method.},

  abstract = {It has been shown previously in Djungarian hamsters that the initial electroencephalography (EEG) slow-wave activity (power in the 0.5--4.0 Hz band; SWA) in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep following an episode of daily torpor is consistently enhanced, similar to the SWA increase after sleep deprivation (SD). However, it is unknown whether the network mechanisms underlying the SWA increase after torpor and SD are similar. EEG slow waves recorded in the neocortex during sleep reflect synchronized transitions between periods of activity and silence among large neuronal populations. We therefore set out to investigate characteristics of individual cortical EEG slow waves recorded during NREM sleep after 4 h SD and during sleep after emergence from an episode of daily torpor in adult male Djungarian hamsters. We found that during the first hour after both SD and torpor, the SWA increase was associated with an increase in slow-wave incidence and amplitude. However, the slopes of single slow waves during NREM sleep were steeper in the first hour after SD but not after torpor, and, in contrast to sleep after SD, the magnitude of change in slopes after torpor was unrelated to the changes in SWA. Furthermore, slow-wave slopes decreased progressively within the first 2 h after SD, while a progressive increase in slow-wave slopes was apparent during the first 2 h after torpor. The data suggest that prolonged waking and torpor have different effects on cortical network activity underlying slow-wave characteristics, while resulting in a similar homeostatic sleep response of SWA. We suggest that sleep plays an important role in network homeostasis after both waking and torpor, consistent with a recovery function for both states.},

Regional sleep EEG differences are thought to be a consequence of activation of specific cortical neuronal circuits during waking. We investigated the relationship between handedness and interhemispheric brain asymmetry. Bilateral EEG recordings were obtained from the frontal and occipital cortex in rats with a clear paw preference in a food-reaching task (right, n = 5; left, n = 5). While still na{\"i}ve to the task, no waking or sleep EEG asymmetry was present. During the food-reaching task, the waking EEG showed significant, substantial power increases in the frontal hemisphere contralateral to the dominant paw in the low theta range (4.5--6.0 Hz). Moreover, the non-REM sleep EEG following feeding bouts was markedly asymmetric, with significantly higher power in the hemisphere contralateral to the preferred paw in frequencies {$>$}1.5 Hz. No asymmetry was evident in the occipital EEG. Correlation analyses revealed a positive association between the hemispheric asymmetry during sleep and the degree of preferred use of the contralateral paw during waking in frequencies {$<$}9.0 Hz. Our findings show that handedness is reflected in specific, regional EEG asymmetry during sleep. Neuronal activity induced by preferential use of a particular forelimb led to a local enhancement of EEG power in frequencies within the delta and sigma ranges, supporting the hypothesis of use-dependent local sleep regulation. We conclude that inherent laterality is manifested when animals are exposed to complex behavioral tasks, and sleep plays a role in consolidating the hemispheric dominance of the brain.},

In the last decade an increasing number of reports continue to support a bidirectional and symbiotic relationship between sleep and memory. Studies using procedural and declarative learning tasks have demonstrated the need for sleep after learning in the offline consolidation of new memories. Furthermore, these consolidation benefits appear to be mediated by an overnight neural reorganization of memory that may result in a more efficient storage of information, affording improved next-day recall. Sleep before learning also appears to be critical for brain functioning. Specifically, one night of sleep deprivation markedly impairs hippocampal function, imposing a deficit in the ability to commit new experiences to memory. Taken together, these observations are of particular ecologic importance from a professional and education perspective when considering that sleep time continues to decrease across all age ranges throughout industrialized nations. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Identification of individual marine mammals can be carried out using tags, brands, paint, dye, photogrammetry, telemetry and other techniques. An analysis of peer-reviewed articles published from January 1980 to April 2011 addressing the effects of marking revealed a preponderance of studies focussed on short-term effects such as injuries and behavioural changes. Some marking techniques were reported to cause pain and to change swimming and haul-out behaviour, maternal attendance, and duration of foraging trips. However, marking has typically not been found to affect survival. No published research has addressed other possible long-term effects of marking related to injuries or pain responses. Studies of the more immediate effects of marking (mostly related to externally attached devices such as radio-transmitters) have shown a variety of different types and magnitudes of responses. It is important to note that studies failing to find treament differences are less likely to be published, meaning that the present and any other reviews based on published literature may be a biased sample of all research conducted on the topic. Publishing results that found no or low impacts (i.e. best practices) as well as those that found significant impacts on animals should both be encouraged. Future research under more controlled conditions is required to document acute effects of marking, including injury and pain, and to better understand longer-term effects on health, reproduction and survival. We recommend that studies using marked animals standardise their reports, with added detail on methodology, monitoring and sampling design, and address practices used to minimise the impact of marking on marine mammals.},

  abstract = {Electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram, electromyogram, and electrocardiogram were recorded from ground squirrels (Citellus beldingi and C. lateralis) during the summer and also during the hibernation season. Summer recordings revealed that the animals spent an average of 66\% of the 24-h period asleep (49\% of the 12-h light period and 84\% of the 12-h dark period); 19\% of the total sleep time (TST) consisted of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, and 81\% of TST consisted of slow-wave sleep (SWS). Recordings obtained during the hibernation season showed that hibernation was entered through sleep, but the distribution of sleep states was different than in euthermic sleep. During the early entrance when brain temperature (Tbr) was between 35 and 25 degrees C, the animals were asleep 88\% of the time, but only 10\% of the TST was spent in REM sleep. The EEG amplitude declined with decreased Tbr so that classical sleep stages could not be identified below a Tbr of 25 degrees C. The frequency of the EEG increased as Tbr decreased; but activity in the 0--4 cycles/s band occupied the majority of the record even at a Tbr of 10 degrees C. Below a Tbr of 10 degrees C the EEG was isoelectric except for intermittent bursts of spindles. It was concluded from these and other results that the entrance into hibernation represents an extension of the thermoregulatory adjustments that occur during SWS.},

Rhetorical approaches remind us that all climate-change arguments are political and that their effects are contingent on the time and place of their presentation. While the research in this area is new and diverse, nevertheless, some common findings emerge: that habitual ways of visualizing climate change work against, not for, effective political action; that rhetorical choices do and should underpin technical climate graphics at fundamental levels; but ironically that nonexperts, and even some experts, perpetuate the myth that climate graphics are transparent, untransformed views of nature. Rhetorical scholarship to date suggests a few paths forward through these problems toward more just, equitable, and effective public deliberation over climate-change policy.

According to these criteria, the representative definitions in the field are analyzed. A new definition is proposed, according to it intelligence means ``adaptation with insufficient knowledge and resources.'' The implications of this definition are discussed, and it is compared with the other definitions.

  abstract = {Background: Acoustic telemetry is a commonly used tool to gain knowledge about aquatic animal ecology through the study of their movements. In telemetry studies researchers must make inferences regarding the movements and the fates of tagged animals. Until recently, predation has been inferred in telemetry data using a variety of methods including abrupt changes in movement patterns or habitat use. An acoustic telemetry transmitter has been developed to detect predation events of tagged animals, and while they have performed well in controlled laboratory trials, literature regarding the application of these novel transmitters in field settings is limited. The objective of this research was to describe the detection data obtained from field studies using predation tags and propose methods to incorporate this information in decision-making about the fate of tagged animals. We implanted 60 yellow perch (Perca flavescens) with predation transmitters and evaluated their spatial use in a receiver array (34 ha) using a combination of centres of activity, roaming indices, and step length measures to examine detection data. Results: Over 5 months, 19 apparent predation events were identified by the transmitters. Roaming indices and centres of activity revealed a variety of detection patterns, including instances of altered behaviour before and after predation that matched tag-indentified predation events, dropped tags post-predation, and detections that ceased post-predation indicating the predator might have left the array. Based on the observed patterns, probable predation was inferred for 15 of 19 triggered tags, with unclear fates for four fish. Conclusions: Our study provided a framework to assess the fate of animals tagged with predation transmitters and demonstrate how these tags can contribute to telemetry studies. We showed how detections can be categorized using tag status to compare movement metrics among individuals, provided tools to explore space use surrounding predation events, and synthesized this information to inform uncertainty surrounding tag-identified predation events. Predation tags do not remove all uncertainty about the fate of tagged individuals, but combined with other metrics they increase the likelihood of identifying abnormal movements that could otherwise introduce biased detection histories into studies of small-sized fishes.},

  abstract = {A defining physiological capability for air-breathing marine vertebrates is the amount of oxygen that can be stored in tissues and made available during dives. To evaluate the influence of oxygen storage capacity on aerobic diving capacity, we examined the extent to which blood and muscle oxygen stores varied as a function of age, body size and sex in the sexually dimorphic California sea lion, Zalophus californianus. We measured total body oxygen stores, including hematocrit, hemoglobin, MCHC, plasma volume, blood volume and muscle myoglobin in pups through adults of both sexes. Blood and muscle oxygen storage capacity was not fully developed by the end of the dependency period, with blood stores not fully developed until animals were larger juveniles (70 kg; 1.5-2.5 years) and muscle stores not until animals were sub-adult size (125 kg; 4-6 years). Differences in aerobic diving capacity among size classes were reflective of these major milestones in the development of oxygen stores. Male sea lions had greater absolute blood volume than females and reflected the larger mass of males, which became apparent when animals were large juveniles. Adult female sea lions had greater muscle myoglobin concentrations compared to males, resulting in greater mass-specific muscle and total oxygen stores. Delayed development of oxygen stores is consistent with the shallow epi-mesopelagic foraging behavior in this species. We hypothesize that the greater mass-specific oxygen stores of female sea lions compared to males is related to differences in foraging behavior between the sexes.},

Volume conductor effects such as the poorly conducting bones or the moderately conducting skin are known to affect the measurement precision and accuracy of the surface electroencephalography (EEG) measurements. This paper investigates the influence of age via skull conductivity upon surface and subdermal bipolar EEG measurement sensitivity conducted on two realistic head models from the Visible Human Project. Subdermal electrodes (a.k.a. subcutaneous electrodes) are implanted on the skull beneath the skin, fat, and muscles. We studied the effect of age upon these two electrode types according to the scalp-to-skull conductivity ratios of 5, 8, 15, and 30: 1. The effects on the measurement sensitivity were studied by means of the half-sensitivity volume (HSV) and the region of interest sensitivity ratio (ROISR). The results indicate that the subdermal implantation notably enhances the precision and accuracy of EEG measurements by a factor of eight compared to the scalp surface measurements. In summary, the evidence indicates that both surface and subdermal EEG measurements benefit better recordings in terms of precision and accuracy on younger patients. Copyright {\copyright} 2010.},

Three tags were recovered allowing detailed behavioral analyses, including one shark's migration cycle from the coast to the offshore focal area and back. While near pinniped rookeries in autumn and winter, sharks avoided the surface and used water to 50 m depth, consistent with a silhouette-based hunting strategy. Offshore migrations were initiated during November-March and followed periods of decreasing pinniped abundance. Migrations were highly directed, taking 23 +/- 5 days to reach the offshore focal area along similar paths among sharks and years, defining a migration corridor. Sharks exhibited a broad depth distribution (0-644 m) in the offshore focal area, and remained there for up to 167 days during spring and summer, though primary productivity and fishery data suggest that forage resources are scarcer there than in other regions of the eastern North Pacific. Archival data from one shark revealed intensive oscillatory movements while in the offshore focal area, a behavior that may be related to foraging or mating. Sharks traveling to Hawaii remained near the islands up to 122 days, potentially feeding on pelagic fishes and marine mammals that concentrate around the islands.},

Objectives: To determine the effects of 2 inhalation anesthetics on the EEG of healthy horses. Animals: Six healthy horses. Methods: Prospective study. After the sole administration of one of either isoflurane or halothane at 1.2, 1.4, and 1.6 times the minimum alveolar concentration, EEG was recorded during controlled ventilation, spontaneous ventilation, and nerve stimulation. Results: Burst suppression was observed with isoflurane, along with EEG events that resembled epileptiform discharges. Halothane results were variable between horses, with epileptiform-like discharges and bursts of theta, alpha, and beta recorded intermittently. One horse died and 2 were euthanized as the result of anesthesia-related complications. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The results of this study indicate that the effects of halothane and isoflurane on EEG activity in the normal horse can be quite variable, even when used in the absence of other drugs. It is recommended that equine EEG be performed without the use of these inhalation anesthetics and that general anesthesia be induced and maintained by other contemporary means.},

  abstract = {Mammals re-entered the oceans less than 60 million years ago. The transition from a terrestrial to an aquatic lifestyle required extreme morphological and behavioural modifications concomitant with fundamentally different locomotor mechanisms for moving on land and through water. Energetic transport costs typically reflect such different locomotor modes, but can not be discerned from the fossil record. In this study the energetic challenges associated with changing from terrestrial to aquatic locomotion in primitive marine mammals are examined by comparing the transport, maintenance and locomotor costs of extant mammals varying in degree of aquatic specialization. The results indicate that running and swimming specialists have converged on an energetic optimum for locomotion. An allometric expression, COTTOT = 7.79 mass-0.29 (r 2 = 0.83, n = 6 species), describes the total cost of transport in J kg-1m-1 for swimming marine mammals ranging in size from 21 kg to 15,000 kg. This relation is indistinguishable from that describing total transport costs in running mammals. In contrast, the transitional lifestyle of semi-aquatic mammals, similar to that of ancestral marine mammals, incurs costs that are 2.4 to 5.1 times higher than locomotor specialists. These patterns suggest that primitive marine mammals confronted an energetic hurdle before returning to costs reminiscent of their terrestrial ancestry, and may have reached an evolutionary limit for energetic optimization during swimming.},

Interpretation of electroencephalograms (EEGs) obtained from sedated horses should take into account background activity, presence of sleep-related EEG events, and the animal's behavior. Hypothesis: Sedatives induce states of vigilance that are indistinguishable on EEGs from those that occur naturally. Animals: Six healthy horses. Methods: Digital EEG with video was recorded after administration of 1 of 4 sedatives (acepromazine, butorphanol, xylazine, or detomidine). Serum drug concentrations were measured. Recordings were reviewed, states were identified, and representative EEG samples were analysed. These data were compared with data previously obtained during a study of natural sleep. Results: Butorphanol was associated with brief episodes resembling slow wave sleep in 1 horse. Acepromazine led to SWS in 3 horses, including 1 that also exhibited rapid eye movement sleep. Periods of SWS were observed in all horses afer xylazine or detomidine administration. Normal sleep-related EEG events and heart block, occurred in association with SWS regardless of which sedative was used. Spectral data varied primarily by state, but some differences were observed between sedative and natural data. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Qualitatively, EEG findings appeared identical whether sedation-induced or naturally occurring. The startle response and heart block associated with some sedatives may be related to sleep. Alpha 2 agonists can be used to obtain high quality EEGs in horses, but acepromazine does not promote a relaxed state in all animals. {\copyright} 2012 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data.

In the absence of environmental time cues, circadian rhythms default to their endogenous period called tau, or the free-running period. This sustained circadian rhythmicity in constant conditions has been reported across the animal kingdom, a ubiquity that could imply that innate rhythmicity confers an adaptive advantage. In this study, we found that the deviation of tau from 24 h was inversely related to the lifespan in laboratory mouse strains, and in other rodent and primate species. These findings support the hypothesis that misalignment of endogenous rhythms and 24 h environmental cycles may be associated with a physiological cost that has an effect on longevity.},

Prevailing cable-connected devices cannot be adapted to data acquisition very well when dolphins are in motion. Therefore, this study designs a novel, light-weighted, and portable EEG acquisition device aimed at relatively unrestricted EEG acquisition. An embedded main control board and an acquisition board were designed, and all modules are encapsulated in a 162 {\texttimes} 94 {\texttimes} 60 mm3 waterproof device box, which can be tied to the dolphin's body by a silicon belt. The acquisition device uses customized suction cups with embedded electrodes and adopts a Bluetooth module for wireless communication with the ground station. The sampled signals are written to the memory card on board when the Bluetooth communication is blocked. A limited experiment was designed to verify the effectiveness of the device functionality onshore and underwater. However, more rigorous long-term tests on dolphins in various states with our device are expected in future to further prove its capability and study the movement-related artifacts.},

  abstract = {The current standard for monitoring sleep in rats requires labor intensive surgical procedures and the implantation of chronic electrodes which have the potential to impact behavior and sleep. With the goal of developing a non-invasive method to determine sleep and wakefulness, we constructed a non-contact monitoring system to measure movement and respiratory activity using signals acquired with pulse Doppler radar and from digitized video analysis. A set of 23 frequency and time-domain features were derived from these signals and were calculated in 10 s epochs. Based on these features, a classification method for automated scoring of wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) and REM in rats was developed using a support vector machine (SVM). We then assessed the utility of the automated scoring system in discriminating wakefulness and sleep by comparing the results to standard scoring of wakefulness and sleep based on concurrently recorded EEG and EMG. Agreement between SVM automated scoring based on selected features and visual scores based on EEG and EMG were approximately 91\% for wakefulness, 84\% for NREM and 70\% for REM. The results indicate that automated scoring based on non-invasively acquired movement and respiratory activity will be useful for studies requiring discrimination of wakefulness and sleep. However, additional information or signals will be needed to improve discrimination of NREM and REM episodes within sleep.},

  abstract = {Bio-logging technology is becoming an ever more common tool for persistent monitoring of people and animals in their natural environment. As a result, the volume and type of information collected by these embedded sensing systems continues to increase, making algorithms that can accurately and efficiently classify and parameterize behavior from sensor data essential. How best to extract information from multiple sensors remains an open question. The problem becomes more challenging in cases where only sparse concurrent human observations of the behavioral states are available to train the algorithm. In this work, the authors present a systematic method to perform feature generation, feature selection and state classification from representative data collected from an example species --- bottlenose dolphins. This approach includes methods for evaluating window size selection during feature generation and the identification of specific feature sets that maximize classification performance. Additionally, the proposed framework incorporates information about state transition probabilities to further improve classification accuracy. Bio-logging sensor and video data for the analysis are collected from free-swimming dolphins at Dolphin Quest Oahu. The concurrent video data is scored by a human expert to create a set of observed behaviors. Results demonstrate that the algorithm is able to classify behavior with a high level of accuracy ({$>$} 90 percent) with 16 features and a window size of 0.6 seconds. Robustness of the proposed approach is evaluated by reducing the training data by 80 percent. The resulting classification accuracy is still above 87 percent. These results serve as the foundation for classification algorithms that can be used with data collected from animals where behavioral states can only be observed sporadically.},

  abstract = {Mice are by far the most widely used species for scientific research including many studies involving biopotentials such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals for sleep analysis. Unfortunately, current methods for the analysis of these systems involve either tethered systems that are restrictive and heavy on the animal or wireless systems using transponders that are large relative to the animal and surgically invasive for implantation; thus natural behavior/activity is altered. Herein, we propose an inexpensive novel system for measuring electroencephalographic signals and other biopotentials in mice that allows for natural movement and evaluate it for the analysis of sleep architecture and EEG power during spontaneous sleep and sleep responses after sleep deprivation in mice. Vigilance states of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS), rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), and wakefulness and EEG power and NREMS EEG delta power in the 0.5--4 Hz range (an indicator of sleep intensity) showed the typical diurnal rhythms found in mice using our new system and these values were similar to mice values using telemetry transponders. Mice that used the new system also demonstrated typical enhanced NREMS EEG delta power responses after sleep deprivation and few signal artifacts. Moreover, similar movement activity counts were found in the new system compared to a wireless system. This novel system for biopotential measuring can be used for polysomnography, infusion, microdialysate, and optogenetic studies providing a platform allowing reduced artifacts and a more natural moving environment for more accurate investigation of biological systems and pharmaceutical development.},

  abstract = {Abstract Marine mammals are under growing pressure as anthropogenic use of the ocean increases. Ship strikes of large whales and loud underwater sound sources including air guns for marine geophysical prospecting and naval midfrequency sonar are criticized for their possible negative effects on marine mammals. Competent authorities regularly require the implementation of mitigation measures, including vessel speed reductions or shutdown of acoustic sources if marine mammals are sighted in sensitive areas or in predefined exclusion zones around a vessel. To ensure successful mitigation, reliable at-sea detection of animals is crucial. To date, ship-based marine mammal observers are the most commonly implemented detection method; however, thermal (IR) imaging--based automatic detection systems have been used in recent years. This study evaluates thermal imaging--based automatic whale detection technology for its use across different oceans. The performance of this technology is characterized with respect to environmental conditions, and an automatic detection algorithm for whale blows is presented. The technology can detect whales in polar, temperate, and subtropical ocean regimes over distances of up to several kilometers and outperforms marine mammal observers in the number of whales detected. These results show that thermal imaging technology can be used to assist in providing protection for marine mammals against ship strike and acoustic impact across the world's oceans.},

  abstract = {Morays (Anguilliformes: Muraenidae) are a large family of marine eels that are poorly known biologically. Twelve species are known to occur in the South Atlantic Bight (SAB), a region of continental shelf and upper slope extending from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, to Cape Canaveral, Florida. Specimens of nine species were obtained from fishery-dependent and fishery-independent sources during May 2005 through April 2007. The most abundant species, Gymnothorax moringa (n = 491), ranged in length from 556-1267 mm TL and age estimates ranged from 4-23 yr. Spawning females were collected from late May through February, with a peak in spawning between June and October. Spawning periodicity estimates ranged from 24-31 days, with nine to twelve spawning events during the spawning season. The second most abundant species, Muraena retifera (n = 53), ranged in size from 573-961 mm TL, with age estimates ranging between 6-24 yr. Spawning females were collected only in June and July. Basic biological information was collected from an additional 44 specimens of seven species. Spatial and temporal abundance of the four most abundant moray species was also examined using a long-term fishery-independent data series. Gymnothorax moringa, G. vicinus and M. retifera were most abundant on shelf-edge hardbottoms (44-110 m), whereas G. saxicola was most common on mid-shelf hardbottoms (18-43 m). The highest catches of morays were from hardbottom habitats off South Carolina and northeast Florida. Species richness was greatest off northeast Florida and on shelf-edge hardbottoms. The temporal abundance of moray species has changed considerably over a 23 yr period, with G. moringa increasing in abundance whereas M. retifera and G. saxicola have both declined in abundance. Distribution of all SAB moray species using fishery-dependent, fishery-independent, as well as museum collection records is presented including range extensions for Anarchias similis and Enchelycore anatina.},
