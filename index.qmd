# Welcome to EcoViz+AI

### Bridging visualization and AI for Ecology

EcoViz+AI is a community of practice born out of a shared vision to empower ecologists to responsibly leverage advances in artificial intelligence through community, education, cyberinfrastructure, and visualization for science communication. We connect researchers, practitioners, and AI experts working at the intersection of technology and ecology to understand, develop, and refine AI tools for ecological applications.

EcoViz+AI 2024 (March 24-29) was organized by [Jessica Kendall-Bar](https://jessiekb.com) and facilitated by [Allison Payne](https://allisonpayne.github.io/) and [Max Czapanskiy](https://flukeandfeather.com/).

### **Our Workshop and Community Origins**

EcoViz+AI started as an intensive, week-long workshop, where participants engaged hands-on with AI models tailored to ecological needs, ranging from annotating citizen science images to classifying whale vocalizations and sleep states in wild animals. This experience highlighted the significant potential of AI in ecology—speeding up data processing, facilitating large-scale analyses, and creating accessible computational ecosystems.

**What We Offer**

-   **Collaborative Learning:** Join future workshops, interactive coding sessions, and [discussion forums](https://join.slack.com/t/ecovizainetwork/shared_invite/zt-2evjz39p1-Bhigc2M1mH7NNrNRrbK3mg) to learn from peers and experts in the field.

-   [**Case Studies**](../casestudies.html)**:** Dive into detailed examples of AI applied to ecological problems, complete with data, code, and instructional videos.

-   [**Model Zoo**](../modelzoo.html)**:** Explore a comprehensive repository of models for various ecological applications. Contribute your models or build on existing ones.

-   [**Communities of Practice**](../communities.html)**:** Explore other communities of practice for ideas of how to engage with ecologists who seek to responsibly leverage AI.

-   **Resources:** Access a curated set of tools, datasets, and computational resources tailored for ecological AI applications.
