[Roles & Expectations](https://www.notion.so/Roles-Expectations-a0cf47ee900844a48ed00dbc237145f1?pvs=21)

- **What:** an in-person workshop to develop 5 use-cases for AI in Science within Ecology.
    - Primary deliverables:
        - 2 Publications:
            - A highly citable ***research paper on 5 use cases in Ecology*** with participants as co-authors ([Methods in Ecology & Evolution](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/2041210x/features/practical_tools))
            - A ***perspective paper on the availability and need for tools for Visualization and AI in Ecology*** with participants as co-authors ([Methods in Ecology & Evolution](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/2041210x/features/practical_tools))
        - ***Website*** to host all 5 tutorials
            - Video introductions to each case study
            - Markdown tutorials for each dataset and AI model
        - ***Community of practice***
            - Listserv & Slack ([Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/ecovizainetwork/shared_invite/zt-2evjz39p1-Bhigc2M1mH7NNrNRrbK3mg)) to connect scientists from the workshop for ongoing collaboration
- **Who:** invited experts in visualization, AI, and Ecology
    - Read more about your [Roles & Expectations](https://www.notion.so/Roles-Expectations-a0cf47ee900844a48ed00dbc237145f1?pvs=21)
- **When:**Â UC Spring Break, March 25-29th, 2024 (dinner on Monday + workshop Tuesday-Friday)
    - **Monday:**Â Travel day and Opening Dinner (required)
        - Objective: *Get to know each other and their fields of interest, build rapport and trust from which to begin the work.*
    - **Tuesday:**Â Day 1- Introductions and planning.
        - Objective: *Understand the data and the AI models being used; set a technical foundation for collaboration and synthesis.*
    - **Wednesday:**Â Day 2- Model development (data wrangling and code refinement).
        - Objective: *Modify AI models to another use case to demonstrate generalizability; document changes, opportunities, challenges, and limitations.*
    - **Thursday:**Â Day 3- Immersive visualization for model refinement.
        - Objective: *Create, identify, and annotate visualizations that assist analysis and communication. Build science communication materials to explain use of AI models.*
    - **Friday:**Â Day 4- Writing, synthesis, and reflections.
        - Objective: *Unify and synthesize work performed during the workshop, reflect on process, opportunities, challenges, and next steps.*
- **Why:**
    - Democratize access to AI, visualization, and computation in Ecology - empowering scientists to leverage new tools
    - To create clear, explainable,Â [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)Â examples of AI-integration in Ecology.
- **Where:**
    - UC San Diego: Scripps Institution of Oceanography and San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC)
